# C# Language Design Notes for Apr 19, 2017


***Raw notes, yet to be cleaned up - read at your own peril***


"I'm not thrilled with the decision, but it was a constrained call"

# Improved common type

``` c#
b ? null : 7 // should be int?
```

This is a small, isolated change that leads to a nice improvement. Let's do it!

# Diamonds with classes

The class should always win. It's implementation in a class is more specific. "Does the class implement this member? No, then look for a default implementation".

# structs and default implementations

Very hard to use default implementations from structs.

Referring to the IB example in the issue.

Only way:

``` c#
public static void Increment<T>(ref T t) where T : IB => t.Increment();
```

Even that won't necessarily avoid boxing! What is the type of `this` in the implementation of `IB.Increment`? If it's `IB`, then `this` is a boxed form of the struct! We can avoid that by having an implicit type parameter, a "this type", which is constrained by `IB`. But then, if that doesn't have a name, you can't use it in the body. If it does have a name, do we need a syntax for that?

For inherited members on structs today, they do in fact get boxed, but it is never observable - because of the behavior of those three methods (`ToString`, etc.).


We can't do 1. - it would undermine the value of the feature. (Because adding a new interface member with a default implementation would break implementing structs).

Number 2. pushes the problem elsewhere, at a high cost and with a high risk that you box later anyway.

Number 3. looks like a cop out but there really doesn't seem like a good alternative. C# already has places where structs and interfaces behave weirdly together.



Can we make it so that structs *inherit* default interface members? That would almost certainly make it breaking.

## Conclusion

Let's stick with 3. It would be a breaking change to do 2 later, so we can never change it.

# Base invocation

Like classes it should generate a non-virtual call.

``` c#
I.base.M()
base(I).M()
base<I>.M()
```

`base(I)` is the winner. It works like `default(T)`.

Should these be permitted in classes too, to get base interface implementations? Yes.

We could actually expand it to classes too, to allow a more distant base implementation to be called. Let's decide that later.

Question: In an interface, can I say `base(IA)` that isn't a *direct* base interface? Yes.
Question: In a class, can I say `base(IA)` that isn't a *direct* base interface? Yes.
