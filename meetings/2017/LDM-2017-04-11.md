## Binary compat 1

The essence is: Does the compiler encode where it gets its implementation from? The answer is no: the runtime gets to look it up. This is similar to classes.

## Binary compat 2

This is in some way a counterexample, because it *would* be resolved if the compilation of C had encoded its choice.

Stake in the ground: fine to fail at compile time, but not at runtime! 

You can't always bake in, because the class may be compiled before the default-implemented member was even added to the interface.


Choices:

1. Error
2. Deterministically pick one of the most specific ones
3. Choice baked into class (can't always work)
	1. and if fails, then 1
	2. and if fails, then 2

This example is represented by `IEnumerable<T>`, `IReadOnlyList<T>` and `IList<T>` in the BCL today.

Either way, there remains a choice between 1 and 2. Is it better to fail fast, or have arbitrary behavior?

We can imagine situations where it's quite unfortunate that other code than "expected" gets run.

Further work:
- Understand what Java *actually* does, versus specs, and what fallout there has been
- Understand where these examples apply to our BCL, for example

Poll:
Runtime pick: 11
Error:		  11
Burn in then pick: 111
Bake in and fail: 11

Not very decisive!
