# Upcoming meetings for 2019

## Schedule ASAP

## Schedule when convenient

- Discussion of refreshing language spec (Neal)
- Allowing pattern-based `foreach` and `await foreach` to bind to an extension `GetEnumerator`/`GetAsyncEnumerator` and `MoveNext`/`MoveNextAsync` (Julien/Chris)
- Making a `CancellationToken` available in async-iterator method bodies; possibly reserving a keyword (Julien/Stephen) 
- Syntax of positional records/primary constructors (Andy)
- Nullable sidecar files (Immo)
- Nullable Reference Types: Open LDM Issues https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2201

#### Default Interface Methods
See also https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/406

- Reabstraction (open)
- explicit interface abstract overrides in classes (open)

#### Pattern-Matching
See also https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2095

- Propose to change precedence of switch expression to primary (open)

  The switch expression is currently at *relational* precedence. I propose to change it to *primary* precedence. See [#2331](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2331) for details.

- Reserve `and` and `or` in patterns (open)

  In anticipation of possibly permitting `and` and `or` as pattern combinators in the future, we should forbid (or at least warn) when these identifiers are used as the designator in a declaration or recursive pattern.  Otherwise it would be a breaking change.

- To where do null inferences flow from a pattern in a `switch`? (open)

  1. To the entry of the switch and all previous cases
  2. To that branch of the switch only
  3. To all code that follows the test in logical order
