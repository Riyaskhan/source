# Foreword

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the national bodies casting a vote.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this standard may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

ISO/IEC 23270 was prepared by Ecma International, a Category A liaison to ISO/IEC JTC 1, and Fast Tracked to ISO/IEC JTC 1.

This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition (ISO/IEC 23270:2006).

The major changes from the previous edition include:

- Addition of
  - default and hidden options on the #line preprocessing directive
  - Fixed-size buffers in unsafe code
  - Automatically implemented properties
  - Implicitly typed local variables and arrays
  - Object and collection initializers
  - Anonymous types
  - Lambda expressions
  - Expression trees
  - Improved type inference
  - Extension methods
  - Query expressions
  - Optional parameters
  - Named arguments
  - Generic variance
  - Dynamic binding
  - Asynchronous functions
  - Caller-info attributes
- Removal of
  - concept of a null type
- Integration of
  - nullable value types
  - generic types and functions
  - iterators

# Introduction

This specification is based on a submission from Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and Microsoft, that described a language called C#, which was developed within Microsoft. The principal inventors of this language were Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde. The first widely distributed implementation of C# was released by Microsoft in July 2000, as part of its .NET Framework initiative.

Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39) [later renamed to TC49] Task Group 2 (TG2) was formed in September 2000, to produce a standard for C#. Another Task Group, TG3, was also formed at that time to produce a standard for a library and execution environment called Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). (CLI is based on a subset of the .NET Framework.) Although Microsoft’s implementation of C# relies on CLI for library and run-time support, other implementations of C# need not, provided they support an alternate way of getting at the minimum CLI features required by this C# standard (see Annex C).

As the definition of C# evolved, the goals used in its design were as follows:

- C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
- The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness, durability, and programmer productivity are important.
- The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for deployment in distributed environments.
- Source code portability is very important, as is programmer portability, especially for those programmers already familiar with C and C++.
- Support for internationalization is very important.
- C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions.
- Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language.

# Scope

This specification describes the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the C# programming language. It describes

- The representation of C# programs;
- The syntax and constraints of the C# language;
- The semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;
- The restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.

This specification does not describe

- The mechanism by which C# programs are transformed for use by a data-processing system;
- The mechanism by which C# applications are invoked for use by a data-processing system;
- The mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C# application;
- The mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C# application;
- The size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;
- All minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.

# General description

> **This text is informative.**
> 
> This specification is intended to be used by implementers, academics, and application programmers. As such, it contains a considerable amount of explanatory material that, strictly speaking, is not necessary in a formal language specification.
> 
> This standard is divided into the following subdivisions: front matter; language syntax, constraints, and semantics; and annexes.
> 
> Examples are provided to illustrate possible forms of the constructions described. References are used to refer to related clauses. Notes are provided to give advice or guidance to implementers or programmers. Annexes provide additional information and summarize the information contained in this specification.

Informative text is indicated in the following ways:

1.  Whole or partial clauses or annexes delimited by “**This clause/text is informative**”and “**End of informative text**”.
2.  [*Example*: The following example … code fragment, possibly with some narrative … *end example*]
3.  [*Note*: narrative … *end note*]

All text not marked as being informative is normative.

# Conformance

Conformance is of interest to the following audiences:

- Those designing, implementing, or maintaining C# implementations.
- Governmental or commercial entities wishing to procure C# implementations.
- Testing organizations wishing to provide a C# conformance test suite.
- Programmers wishing to port code from one C# implementation to another.
- Educators wishing to teach Standard C#.
- Authors wanting to write about Standard C#.

As such, conformance is most important, and the bulk of this specification is aimed at specifying the characteristics that make C# implementations and C# programs conforming ones.

The text in this specification that specifies requirements is considered ***normative***. All other text in this specification is ***informative***; that is, for information purposes only. Unless stated otherwise, all text is normative. Normative text is further broken into ***required*** and ***conditional*** categories. ***Conditionally normative*** text specifies a feature and its requirements where the feature is optional. However, if that feature is provided, its syntax and semantics shall be exactly as specified.

Undefined behavior is indicated in this specification only by the words ‘‘undefined behavior.’’

A ***strictly conforming program*** shall use only those features of the language specified in this specification as being required. (This means that a strictly conforming program cannot use any conditionally normative feature.) It shall not produce output dependent on any unspecified, undefined, or implementation-defined behavior.

A ***conforming implementation*** of C# shall accept any strictly conforming program.

A conforming implementation of C# shall provide and support all the types, values, objects, properties, methods, and program syntax and semantics described in the normative (but not the conditionally normative) parts in this specification.

A conforming implementation of C# shall interpret characters in conformance with the Unicode Standard. Conforming implementations shall accept Unicode source files encoded with the UTF-8 encoding form.

A conforming implementation of C# shall not successfully translate source containing a #error preprocessing directive unless it is part of a group skipped by conditional compilation.

A conforming implementation of C# shall produce at least one diagnostic message if the source program violates any rule of syntax, or any negative requirement (defined as a “shall” or “shall not” or “error” or “warning” requirement), unless that requirement is marked with the words “no diagnostic is required”.

A conforming implementation of C# is permitted to provide additional types, values, objects, properties, and methods beyond those described in this specification, provided they do not alter the behavior of any strictly conforming program. Conforming implementations are required to diagnose programs that use extensions that are ill formed according to this specification. Having done so, however, they can compile and execute such programs. (The ability to have extensions implies that a conforming implementation reserves no identifiers other than those explicitly reserved in this specification.)

A conforming implementation of C# shall be accompanied by a document that defines all implementation-defined characteristics, and all extensions.

A conforming implementation of C# shall support the class library documented in Annex C. This library is included by reference in this specification.

A ***conforming program*** is one that is acceptable to a conforming implementation. (Such a program is permitted to contain extensions or conditionally normative features.)

# Lexical structure

## Programs

A C# ***program*** consists of one or more ***source files***, known formally as ***compilation units*** (§14.2). A source file is an ordered sequence of Unicode characters. Source files typically have a one-to-one correspondence with files in a file system, but this correspondence is not required.

Conceptually speaking, a program is compiled using three steps:

1.  Transformation, which converts a file from a particular character repertoire and encoding scheme into a sequence of Unicode characters.
2.  Lexical analysis, which translates a stream of Unicode input characters into a stream of tokens.
3.  Syntactic analysis, which translates the stream of tokens into executable code.

Conforming implementations shall accept Unicode source files encoded with the UTF-8 encoding form (as defined by the Unicode standard), and transform them into a sequence of Unicode characters. Implementations can choose to accept and transform additional character encoding schemes (such as UTF-16, UTF-32, or non-Unicode character mappings).

> [!NOTE]
> The handling of the Unicode NULL character (U+0000) is implementation-specific. It is strongly recommended that developers avoid using this character in their source code, for the sake of both portability and readability. When the character is required within a character or string literal, the escape sequences \\0 or \\u0000 may be used instead.

> [!NOTE]
> It is beyond the scope of this standard to define how a file using a character representation other than Unicode might be transformed into a sequence of Unicode characters. During such transformation, however, it is recommended that the usual line-separating character (or sequence) in the other character set be translated to the two-character sequence consisting of the Unicode carriage-return character (U+000D) followed by Unicode line-feed character (U+000A). For the most part this transformation will have no visible effects; however, it will affect the interpretation of verbatim string literal tokens (§7.4.5.6). The purpose of this recommendation is to allow a verbatim string literal to produce the same character sequence when its source file is moved between systems that support differing non-Unicode character sets, in particular, those using differing character sequences for line-separation.

## Grammars

### General

This specification presents the syntax of the C# programming language using two grammars. The ***lexical grammar*** (§7.2.2) defines how Unicode characters are combined to form line terminators, white space, comments, tokens, and pre-processing directives. The ***syntactic grammar*** (§7.2.4) defines how the tokens resulting from the lexical grammar are combined to form C# programs.

### Grammar notation

The lexical and syntactic grammars are presented using ***grammar productions***. Each grammar production defines a non-terminal symbol and the possible expansions of that non-terminal symbol into sequences of non-terminal or terminal symbols. In grammar productions, *non-terminal* symbols are shown in italic type, and terminal symbols are shown in a fixed-width font.

The first line of a grammar production is the name of the non-terminal symbol being defined, followed by one or two colons. One colon is used for a production in the syntactic grammar, two colons for a production in the lexical grammar. Each successive indented line contains a possible expansion of the non-terminal given as a sequence of non-terminal or terminal symbols. [*Example*: The production:

```antlr
while-statement:
    while ( boolean-expression ) embedded-statement
```

defines a *while-statement* to consist of the token `while`, followed by the token “`(`”, followed by a *boolean-expression*, followed by the token “`)`”, followed by an *embedded-statement*. *end example*]

When there is more than one possible expansion of a non-terminal symbol, the alternatives are listed on separate lines. [*Example*: The production:

```antlr
statement-list:
    statement
    statement-list statement
```

defines a *statement-list* to either consist of a *statement* or consist of a *statement-list* followed by a *statement*. In other words, the definition is recursive and specifies that a statement list consists of one or more statements. *end example*]

A subscripted suffix “*opt*” is used to indicate an optional symbol. [*Example*: The production:

```antlr
block:
    { statement-listopt }
```

is shorthand for:

```antlr
block:
    { }
    { statement-list }
```

and defines a *block* to consist of an optional *statement-list* enclosed in “`{`” and “`}`” tokens. *end example*]

Alternatives are normally listed on separate lines, though in cases where there are many alternatives, the phrase “one of” may precede a list of expansions given on a single line. This is simply shorthand for listing each of the alternatives on a separate line. [*Example*: The production:

```antlr
real-type-suffix:: one of
    F f D d M m
```

is shorthand for:

```antlr
real-type-suffix::
    F
    f
    D
    d
    M
    m
```

*end example*]

All terminal characters are to be understood as the appropriate Unicode character from the range `U+0020` to `U+007F`, as opposed to any similar-looking characters from other Unicode character ranges.

### Lexical grammar

The lexical grammar of C# is presented in §7.3, §7.4, and §7.5. The terminal symbols of the lexical grammar are the characters of the Unicode character set, and the lexical grammar specifies how characters are combined to form tokens (§7.4), white space (§7.3.4), comments (§7.3.3), and pre-processing directives (§7.5).

Every source file in a C# program shall conform to the *input* production of the lexical grammar (§7.3.1).

### Syntactic grammar

The syntactic grammar of C# is presented in the clauses, subclauses, and annexes that follow this subclause. The terminal symbols of the syntactic grammar are the tokens defined by the lexical grammar, and the syntactic grammar specifies how tokens are combined to form C# programs.

Every source file in a C# program shall conform to the *compilation-unit* production (§14.2) of the syntactic grammar.

### Grammar ambiguities

The productions for *simple-name* (§12.7.3) and *member-access* (§12.7.5) can give rise to ambiguities in the grammar for expressions. [*Example*: The statement:

```csharp
F(G<A, B>(7));
```

could be interpreted as a call to `F` with two arguments, `G < A` and `B > (7)`. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as a call to `F` with one argument, which is a call to a generic method `G` with two type arguments and one regular argument. *end example*]

If a sequence of tokens can be parsed (in context) as a *simple-name* (§12.7.3), *member-access* (§12.7.5), or *pointer-member-access* (§23.6.3) ending with a *type-argument-list* (§9.4.2), the token immediately following the closing `>` token is examined. If it is one of

`( ) ] : ; , . ? == !=`

then the *type-argument-list* is retained as part of the *simple-name*, *member-access*, or *pointer-member-access* and any other possible parse of the sequence of tokens is discarded. Otherwise, the *type-argument-list* is not considered part of the *simple-name*, *member-access*, or *pointer-member-access*, even if there is no other possible parse of the sequence of tokens. 

> [!NOTE]
> These rules are not applied when parsing a *type-argument-list* in a *namespace-or-type-name* (§8.8). 

[*Example*: The statement:

```csharp
F(G<A, B>(7));
```

will, according to this rule, be interpreted as a call to `F` with one argument, which is a call to a generic method `G` with two type arguments and one regular argument. The statements

```csharp
F(G<A, B>7);
F(G<A, B>>7);
```

will each be interpreted as a call to `F` with two arguments. The statement

```csharp
x = F<A> + y;
```

will be interpreted as a less-than operator, greater-than operator and unary-plus operator, as if the statement had been written `x = (F < A) > (+y)`, instead of as a *simple-name* with a *type-argument-list* followed by a binary-plus operator. In the statement

```csharp
x = y is C<T> && z;
```

the tokens `C<T>` are interpreted as a *namespace-or-type-name* with a *type-argument-list* due to being on the right-hand side of the is operator (§12.11.1). Because `C<T>` parses as a *namespace-or-type-name*, not a *simple-name*, *member-access*, or *pointer-member-access*, the above rule does not apply, and it is considered to have a *type-argument-list* regardless of the token that follows. *end example*]

## Lexical analysis

### General

The *input* production defines the lexical structure of a C# source file. Each source file in a C# program shall conform to this lexical grammar production.

```antlr
input::
    input-sectionopt

input-section::
    input-section-part
    input-section input-section-part

input-section-part::
    input-elementsopt new-line
    pp-directive

input-elements::
    input-element
    input-elements input-element

input-element::
    whitespace
    comment
    token
```

Five basic elements make up the lexical structure of a C# source file: Line terminators (§7.3.2), white space (§7.3.4), comments (§7.3.3), tokens (§7.4), and pre-processing directives (§7.5). Of these basic elements, only tokens are significant in the syntactic grammar of a C# program (§7.2.4), except in the case of a `>` token being combined with another token to form a single operator (§7.4.6).

The lexical processing of a C# source file consists of reducing the file into a sequence of tokens that becomes the input to the syntactic analysis. Line terminators, white space, and comments can serve to separate tokens, and pre-processing directives can cause sections of the source file to be skipped, but otherwise these lexical elements have no impact on the syntactic structure of a C# program.

When several lexical grammar productions match a sequence of characters in a source file, the lexical processing always forms the longest possible lexical element. [*Example*: The character sequence `//` is processed as the beginning of a single-line comment because that lexical element is longer than a single `/` token. *end example*]

### Line terminators

Line terminators divide the characters of a C# source file into lines.

```antlr
new-line::
    Carriage return character (*U+000D*)
    Line feed character (*U+000A*)
    Carriage return character (*U+000D*) followed by line feed character (*U+000A*)
    Next line character (*U+0085*)
    Line separator character (*U+2028*)
    Paragraph separator character (*U+2029*)
```

For compatibility with source code editing tools that add end-of-file markers, and to enable a source file to be viewed as a sequence of properly terminated lines, the following transformations are applied, in order, to every source file in a C# program:

- If the last character of the source file is a Control-Z character (`U+001A`), this character is deleted.
- A carriage-return character (`U+000D`) is added to the end of the source file if that source file is non-empty and if the last character of the source file is not a carriage return (`U+000D`), a line feed (`U+000A`), a next line character (`U+0085`), a line separator (`U+2028`), or a paragraph separator (`U+2029`). 

> [!NOTE]
> The additional carriage-return allows a program to end in a *pp-directive* (§7.5) that does not have a terminating *new-line*. 

### Comments

Two forms of comments are supported: delimited comments and single-line comments.

A ***delimited comment*** begins with the characters `/*` and ends with the characters `*/`. Delimited comments can occupy a portion of a line, a single line, or multiple lines. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
/* Hello, world program
This program writes “hello, world” to the console */
class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine ("hello, world");
    }
}
```

includes a delimited comment. *end example*]

A ***single-line comment*** begins with the characters `//` and extends to the end of the line. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
// Hello, world program
// This program writes “hello, world” to the console
//
class Hello // any name will do for this class
{
    static void Main()
    { // this method must be named "Main"
        System.Console.WriteLine ("hello, world");
    }
}
```

shows several single-line comments. *end example*]

```antlr

Comments do not nest. The character sequences `/*` and `*/` have no special meaning within a single-line comment, and the character sequences `//` and `/*` have no special meaning within a delimited comment.

Comments are not processed within character and string literals.

> [!NOTE]
> These rules must be interpreted carefully. For instance, in the example below, the delimited comment that begins before A ends between B and C(). The reason is that
>
> ```csharp
> // B */ C();
> ```
>
> is not actually a single-line comment, since `//` has no special meaning within a delimited comment, and so `*/` does have its usual special meaning in that line.
> 
> Likewise, the delimited comment starting before `D` ends before `E`. The reason is that "`D */` " is not actually a string literal, since it appears inside a delimited comment.
> 
> A useful consequence of `/*` and `*/` having no special meaning within a single-line comment is that a block of source code lines can be commented out by putting `//` at the beginning of each line. In general it does not work to put `/*` before those lines and `*/` after them, as this does not properly encapsulate delimited comments in the block, and in general may completely change the structure of such delimited comments.

### White space

White space is defined as any character with Unicode class `Zs` (which includes the space character) as well as the horizontal tab character, the vertical tab character, and the form feed character.

```antlr
whitespace::
    whitespace-character
    whitespace whitespace-character

whitespace-character::
    Any character with Unicode class Zs
    Horizontal tab character (*U+0009*)
    Vertical tab character (*U+000B*)
    Form feed character (*U+000C*)
```

## Tokens

### General

There are several kinds of ***token***s: identifiers, keywords, literals, operators, and punctuators. White space and comments are not tokens, though they act as separators for tokens.

```antlr
token::
    identifier
    keyword
    integer-literal
    real-literal
    character-literal
    string-literal
    operator-or-punctuator
```

### Unicode character escape sequences

A Unicode escape sequence represents a Unicode code point. Unicode escape sequences are processed in identifiers (§7.4.3), character literals (§7.4.5.5), and regular string literals (§7.4.5.6). A Unicode escape sequence is not processed in any other location (for example, to form an operator, punctuator, or keyword).

```antlr
unicode-escape-sequence::
    \u hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit
    \U hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit hex-digit
```

A Unicode character escape sequence represents the single Unicode code point formed by the hexadecimal number following the “`\u`” or “`\U`” characters. Since C# uses a 16-bit encoding of Unicode code points in character and string values, a Unicode code point in the range `U+10000` to `U+10FFFF` is represented using two Unicode surrogate code units. Unicode code points above `U+FFFF` are not permitted in character literals. Unicode code points above `U+10FFFF` are invalid and are not supported.

Multiple translations are not performed. For instance, the string literal “`\u005Cu005C`” is equivalent to “`\u005C`” rather than “`\`”. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Unicode value `\u005C` is the character “`\`”. 

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
class Class1
{
    static void Test (bool\ u0066)
    {
        char c = '\u0066';
        if (\u0066)
            System.Console.WriteLine (c.ToString ());
    }
}
```

shows several uses of `\u0066`, which is the escape sequence for the letter “f”. The program is equivalent to

```csharp
class Class1
{
    static void Test (bool f)
    {
        char c = 'f';
        if (f)
            System.Console.WriteLine (c.ToString ());
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Identifiers

The rules for identifiers given in this subclause correspond exactly to those recommended by the Unicode Standard Annex 15 except that underscore is allowed as an initial character (as is traditional in the C programming language), Unicode escape sequences are permitted in identifiers, and the “@” character is allowed as a prefix to enable keywords to be used as identifiers.

```antlr
identifier::
    available-identifier
    @ identifier-or-keyword

available-identifier::
    An identifier-or-keyword that is not a keyword

identifier-or-keyword::
    identifier-start-character identifier-part-charactersopt

identifier-start-character::
    letter-character
    underscore-character[]

underscore-character::
    _ (the underscore character U+005F)
    A unicode-escape-sequence representing the character U+005F[]

identifier-part-characters::
    identifier-part-character
    identifier-part-characters identifier-part-character

identifier-part-character::
    letter-character
    decimal-digit-character
    connecting-character
    combining-character
    formatting-character

letter-character::
    A Unicode character of classes Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, or Nl
    A unicode-escape-sequence representing a character of classes Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, or Nl

combining-character::
    A Unicode character of classes Mn or Mc
    A unicode-escape-sequence representing a character of classes Mn or Mc

decimal-digit-character::
    A Unicode character of the class Nd
    A unicode-escape-sequence representing a character of the class Nd

connecting-character::
    A Unicode character of the class Pc
    A unicode-escape-sequence representing a character of the class Pc

formatting-character::
    A Unicode character of the class Cf
    A unicode-escape-sequence representing a character of the class Cf
```

> [!NOTE]
> For information on the Unicode character classes mentioned above, see *The Unicode Standard*.

[*Example*: Examples of valid identifiers include “`identifier1`”, “`_identifier2`”, and “`@if`”. *end example*]

An identifier in a conforming program shall be in the canonical format defined by Unicode Normalization Form C, as defined by Unicode Standard Annex 15. The behavior when encountering an identifier not in Normalization Form C is implementation-defined; however, a diagnostic is not required.

The prefix “@” enables the use of keywords as identifiers, which is useful when interfacing with other programming languages. The character @ is not actually part of the identifier, so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier, without the prefix. An identifier with an @ prefix is called a ***verbatim identifier*.** 
> [!NOTE]
> Use of the @ prefix for identifiers that are not keywords is permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style.

[*Example*: The example:

```csharp
class @class
{
    public static void @static (bool @bool)
    {
        if (@bool)
            System.Console.WriteLine ("true");
        else
            System.Console.WriteLine ("false");
    }
}

class Class1
{
    static void M ()
    {
        cl\\ u0061ss.st\\ u0061tic (true);
    }
}
```

defines a class named “`class`” with a static method named “`static`” that takes a parameter named “`bool`”. Note that since Unicode escapes are not permitted in keywords, the token “`cl\\u0061ss`” is an identifier, and is the same identifier as “`@class`”. *end example*]

Two identifiers are considered the same if they are identical after the following transformations are applied, in order:

- The prefix “@”, if used, is removed.
- Each *unicode-escape-sequence* is transformed into its corresponding Unicode character.
- Any *formatting-character*s are removed.

Identifiers containing two consecutive underscore characters (`U+`005F`) are reserved for use by the implementation; however, no diagnostic is required if such an identifier is defined. 
> [!NOTE]
> For example, an implementation might provide extended keywords that begin with two underscores.

### Keywords

A ***keyword*** is an identifier-like sequence of characters that is reserved, and cannot be used as an identifier except when prefaced by the @ character.

```antlr
keyword:: one of
    abstract as base bool break
    byte case catch char checked
    class const continue decimal default
    delegate do double else enum
    event explicit extern false finally
    fixed float for foreach goto
    if implicit in int interface
    internal is lock long namespace
    new null object operator out
    override params private protected public
    readonly ref return sbyte sealed
    short sizeof stackalloc static string
    struct switch this throw true
    try typeof uint ulong unchecked
    unsafe ushort using virtual void
    volatile while
```

A ***contextual keyword*** is an identifier-like sequence of characters that has special meaning in certain contexts, but is not reserved, and can be used as an identifier outside of those contexts as well as when prefaced by the @ character.

```antlr
contextual-keyword: *one of the following identifiers
    add alias ascending async await
    by descending dynamic equals from
    get global group into join
    let orderby partial remove select
    set value var where yield
```

In most cases, the syntactic location of contextual keywords is such that they can never be confused with ordinary identifier usage. For example, within a property declaration, the “get” and “set” identifiers have special meaning (§15.7.3). An identifier other than get or set is never permitted in these locations, so this use does not conflict with a use of these words as identifiers.

In certain cases the grammar is not enough to distinguish contextual keyword usage from identifiers. In all such cases it will be specified how to disambiguate between the two. For example, the contextual keyword var in implicitly typed local variable declarations (§13.6.2) might conflict with a declared type called var, in which case the declared name takes precedence over the use of the identifier as a contextual keyword.

Another example such disambiguation is the contextual keyword await (§12.8.8.1), which is considered a keyword only when inside a method declared async, but can be used as an identifier elsewhere.

Just as with keywords, contextual keywords can be used as ordinary identifiers by prefixing them with the `@` character.

> [!NOTE]
> When used as contextual keywords, these identifiers cannot contain unicode-escape-sequences.

### Literals

#### General

A ***literal*** (§12.7.2) is a source code representation of a value.

```antlr
literal::
    boolean-literal
    integer-literal
    real-literal
    character-literal
    string-literal
    null-literal
```

#### Boolean literals

There are two Boolean literal values: `true` and `false`.

```antlr
boolean-literal::
    true
    false
```

The type of a *boolean-literal* is bool.

#### Integer literals

Integer literals are used to write values of types `int`, `uint`, `long`, and `ulong`. Integer literals have two possible forms: decimal and hexadecimal.

```antlr
integer-literal::
    decimal-integer-literal
    hexadecimal-integer-literal

decimal-integer-literal::
    decimal-digits integer-type-suffixopt

decimal-digits::
    decimal-digit
    decimal-digits decimal-digit

decimal-digit:: one of
    *0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9*

integer-type-suffix:: one of
    U u L l UL Ul uL ul LU Lu lU lu

hexadecimal-integer-literal::
    0x hex-digits integer-type-suffixopt
    0X hex-digits integer-type-suffixopt

hex-digits::
    hex-digit
    hex-digits hex-digit

hex-digit:: one of
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f
```

The type of an integer literal is determined as follows:

- If the literal has no suffix, it has the first of these types in which its value can be represented: `int`, `uint`, `long`, ``ulong`.
- If the literal is suffixed by U or u, it has the first of these types in which its value can be represented: `uint`, `ulong`.
- If the literal is suffixed by L or l, it has the first of these types in which its value can be represented: ``long`, ``ulong`.
- If the literal is suffixed by UL, Ul, uL, ul, LU, Lu, lU, or lu, it is of type `ulong`.

If the value represented by an integer literal is outside the range of the `ulong` type, a compile-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> As a matter of style, it is suggested that “L” be used instead of “l” when writing literals of type `long`, since it is easy to confuse the letter “l” with the digit “1”.

To permit the smallest possible int and long values to be written as integer literals, the following two rules exist:

- When an *integer-literal* representing the value 2147483648 (2^31^) and no *integer-type-suffix* appears as the token immediately following a unary minus operator token (§12.8.3), the result (of both tokens) is a constant of type `int` with the value −2147483648 (−2^31^). In all other situations, such an *integer-literal* is of type `uint`.
- When an *integer-literal* representing the value 9223372036854775808 (2^63^) and no *integer-type-suffix* or the *integer-type-suffix* L or l appears as the token immediately following a unary minus operator token (§12.8.3), the result (of both tokens) is a constant of type `long` with the value −9223372036854775808 (−2^63^). In all other situations, such an *integer-literal* is of type `ulong`.

#### Real literals

Real literals are used to write values of types `float`, `double`, and `decimal`.

```antlr
real-literal::
    decimal-digits . decimal-digits exponent-partopt real-type-suffixopt
    . decimal-digits exponent-partopt real-type-suffixopt
    decimal-digits exponent-part real-type-suffixopt
    decimal-digits real-type-suffix

exponent-part::
    e signopt decimal-digits
    E signopt decimal-digits

sign:: one of
    + -

real-type-suffix:: one of
    F f D d M m
```

If no *real-type-suffix* is specified, the type of the *real-literal* is `double`. Otherwise, the *real-type-suffix* determines the type of the real literal, as follows:

- A real literal suffixed by F or f is of type `float`. [*Example*: The literals `1f`, `1.5f`, `1e10f`, and `123.456F` are all of type `float`. *end example*]
- A real literal suffixed by D or d is of type `double`. [*Example*: The literals `1d`, `1.5d`, `1e10d`, and `123.456D` are all of type `double`. *end example*]
- A real literal suffixed by M or m is of type `decimal`. [*Example*: The literals `1m`, `1.5m`, `1e10m`, and `123.456M` are all of type `decimal`. *end example*] This literal is converted to a `decimal` value by taking the exact value, and, if necessary, rounding to the nearest representable value using banker's rounding (§9.3.8). Any scale apparent in the literal is preserved unless the value is rounded. [*Note*: Hence, the literal `2.900m` will be parsed to form the `decimal` with sign 0, coefficient 2900, and scale 3. *end note*]

If the magnitude of the specified literal is too large to be represented in the indicated type, a compile-time error occurs. 
> [!NOTE]
> In particular, a *real-literal* will never produce a floating-point infinity. A non-zero *real-literal* may, however, be rounded to zero. 

The value of a real literal of type `float` or `double` is determined by using the IEC 60559 “round to nearest” mode with ties broken to “even” (a value with the least-significant-bit zero), and all digits considered significant.

> [!NOTE]
> In a real literal, decimal digits are always required after the decimal point. For example, `1.3F` is a real literal but `1.F` is not.

#### Character literals

A character literal represents a single character, and consists of a character in quotes, as in 'a'.

```antlr
character-literal::
`' character '

character::
    single-character
    simple-escape-sequence
    hexadecimal-escape-sequence
    unicode-escape-sequence

single-character::
    Any character except ' (*U+0027*), \\ (*U+005C*), and new-line-character

simple-escape-sequence:: one of
    \\' \\" \\\\ \\0 \\a \\b \\f \\n \\r \\t \\v

hexadecimal-escape-sequence::
    \\x hex-digit hex-digitopt hex-digitopt hex-digitopt
```

> [!NOTE]
> A character that follows a backslash character (\\) in a *character* shall be one of the following characters: ', ", \\, 0, a, b, f, n, r, t, u, U, x, v. Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of the \\x *hexadecimal-escape-sequence* production can be error-prone and hard to read due to the variable number of hexadecimal digits following the \\x. For example, in the code:
> ```csharp
> string good = "\\x9Good text";
> 
> string bad = "\\x9Bad text";
> ```
> it might appear at first that the leading character is the same (`U+0009`, a tab character) in both strings. In fact the second string starts with `U+9BAD` as all three letters in the word "Bad" are valid hexadecimal digits. As a matter of style, it is recommended that `\\x` is avoided in favour of either specific escape sequences (`\\t` in this example) or the fixed-length `\\u` escape sequence.

A hexadecimal escape sequence represents a single Unicode UTF-16 code unit, with the value formed by the hexadecimal number following “`\\x`”.

If the value represented by a character literal is greater than `U+FFFF`, a compile-time error occurs.

A Unicode escape sequence (§7.4.2) in a character literal shall be in the range `U+0000` to `U+FFFF`.

A simple escape sequence represents a Unicode character, as described in the table below.

|  **Escape sequence**  | **Character name**  | **Unicode code point**  |
|  ---------------------| --------------------| ------------------------|
|  \\'                  | Single quote        | U+0027                  |
|  \\"                  | Double quote        | U+0022                  |
|  \\\\                 | Backslash           | U+005C                  |
|  \\0                  | Null                | U+0000                  |
|  \\a                  | Alert               | U+0007                  |
|  \\b                  | Backspace           | U+0008                  |
|  \\f                  | Form feed           | U+000C                  |
|  \\n                  | New line            | U+000A                  |
|  \\r                  | Carriage return     | U+000D                  |
|  \\t                  | Horizontal tab      | U+0009                  |
|  \\v                  | Vertical tab        | U+000B                  |

The type of a *character-literal* is char.

#### String literals

C# supports two forms of string literals: ***regular string literals*** and ***verbatim string literals***. A regular string literal consists of zero or more characters enclosed in double quotes, as in "hello", and can include both simple escape sequences (such as `\\t` for the tab character), and hexadecimal and Unicode escape sequences.

A verbatim string literal consists of an `@` character followed by a double-quote character, zero or more characters, and a closing double-quote character. [*Example*: A simple example is `@"hello"`. *end example*] In a verbatim string literal, the characters between the delimiters are interpreted verbatim, with the only exception being a *quote-escape-sequence*, which represents one double-quote character. In particular, simple escape sequences, and hexadecimal and Unicode escape sequences are not processed in verbatim string literals. A verbatim string literal may span multiple lines.

```antlr
string-literal::
    regular-string-literal
    verbatim-string-literal

regular-string-literal::
    " regular-string-literal-charactersopt "

regular-string-literal-characters::
    regular-string-literal-character
    regular-string-literal-characters regular-string-literal-character

regular-string-literal-character::
    single-regular-string-literal-character
    simple-escape-sequence
    hexadecimal-escape-sequence
    unicode-escape-sequence

single-regular-string-literal-character::
    Any character except " (U+0022), \\ (U+005C), and new-line-character

verbatim-string-literal::
    @" verbatim-string-literal-charactersopt "

verbatim-string-literal-characters::
    verbatim-string-literal-character
    verbatim-string-literal-characters verbatim-string-literal-character

verbatim-string-literal-character::
    single-verbatim-string-literal-character
    quote-escape-sequence

single-verbatim-string-literal-character::
    Any character except "

quote-escape-sequence::
    ""
```

[*Example*: The example
```csharp
string a = "Happy birthday, Joel"; // Happy birthday, Joel
string b = @"Happy birthday, Joel"; // Happy birthday, Joel

string c = "hello \\t world"; // hello world
string d = @"hello \\t world"; // hello \\t world

string e = "Joe said \\"Hello\\" to me"; // Joe said "Hello" to me
string f = @"Joe said ""Hello"" to me"; // Joe said "Hello" to me

string g = "\\\\\\\\server\\\\share\\\\file.txt"; // \\\\server\\share\\file.txt
string h = @"\\\\server\\share\\file.txt"; // \\\\server\\share\\file.txt

string i = "one\\r\\ntwo\\r\\nthree";
string j = @"one
two
three";
```

shows a variety of string literals. The last string literal, j, is a verbatim string literal that spans multiple lines. The characters between the quotation marks, including white space such as new line characters, are preserved verbatim, and each pair of double-quote characters is replaced by one such character. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> Any line breaks within verbatim string literals are part of the resulting string. If the exact characters used to form line breaks are semantically relevant to an application, any tools that translate line breaks in source code to different formats (between "`\\n`" and "`\\r\\n`", for example) will change application behavior. Developers should be careful in such situations.

> [!NOTE]
> Since a hexadecimal escape sequence can have a variable number of hex digits, the string literal "`\\x123`" contains a single character with hex value 123. To create a string containing the character with hex value 12 followed by the character 3, one could write "`\\x00123`" or "`\\x12`" + "3" instead. 

The type of a *string-literal* is string.

Each string literal does not necessarily result in a new string instance. When two or more string literals that are equivalent according to the string equality operator (§12.11.8), appear in the same assembly, these string literals refer to the same string instance. [*Example*: For instance, the output produced by

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        object a = "hello";
        object b = "hello";
        System.Console.WriteLine (a == b);
    }
}
```

is `True` because the two literals refer to the same string instance. *end example*]

#### The null literal

```antlr
null-literal::
    null
```

A *null-literal* represents a null value. It does not have a type, but can be converted to any reference type or nullable value type through a null literal conversion (§11.2.6)."

### Operators and punctuators

There are several kinds of operators and punctuators. Operators are used in expressions to describe operations involving one or more operands. [*Example*: The expression `a + b` uses the + operator to add the two operands a and b. *end example*] Punctuators are for grouping and separating.

```antlr
operator-or-punctuator:: one of
    { } [ ] ( ) . , : ;
    + - * / % & | \^ ! \ ~
    = < > ? ?? :: ++ -- && ||
    -> == != <= >= += -= *= /= %=
    &= |= \^= << <<=

right-shift::
    > >

right-shift-assignment::
    > >=
```

*right-shift* is made up of the two tokens `>` and `>`. Similarly, *right-shift-assignment* is made up of the two tokens `>` and `>=`. Unlike other productions in the syntactic grammar, no characters of any kind (not even whitespace) are allowed between the two tokens in each of these productions. These productions are treated specially in order to enable the correct handling of *type-parameter-lists* (§15.2.3). 
> [!NOTE]
> Prior to the addition of generics to C#, `>>` and `>>=` were both single tokens. However, the syntax for generics uses the `<` and `>` characters to delimit type parameters and type arguments. It is often desirable to use nested constructed types, such as `List<Dictionary<string, int>>`. Rather than requiring the programmer to separate the `>` and `>` by a space, the definition of the two *operator-or-punctuator*s was changed. 

## Pre-processing directives

### General

The pre-processing directives provide the ability to skip conditionally sections of source files, to report error and warning conditions, and to delineate distinct regions of source code. 
> [!NOTE]
> The term “pre-processing directives” is used only for consistency with the C and C++ programming languages. In C#, there is no separate pre-processing step; pre-processing directives are processed as part of the lexical analysis phase. 

```antlr
pp-directive::
    pp-declaration
    pp-conditional
    pp-line
    pp-diagnostic
    pp-region
    pp-pragma
```

The following pre-processing directives are available:
- `#define` and `#undef`, which are used to define and undefine, respectively, conditional compilation symbols (§7.5.4).
- `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif`, which are used to skip conditionally sections of source code (§7.5.5).
- `#line`, which is used to control line numbers emitted for errors and warnings (§7.5.8).
- `#error`, which is used to issue errors (§7.5.6).
- `#region` and `#endregion`, which are used to explicitly mark sections of source code (§7.5.7).
- `#pragma`, which is used to specify optional contextual information to a compiler (§7.5.9).

A pre-processing directive always occupies a separate line of source code and always begins with a `#` character and a pre-processing directive name. White space may occur before the `#` character and between the `#` character and the directive name.

A source line containing a `#define`, `#undef`, `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`, `#endif`, `#line`, or `#endregion` directive can end with a single-line comment. Delimited comments (the `/* */ `style of comments) are not permitted on source lines containing pre-processing directives.

Pre-processing directives are not tokens and are not part of the syntactic grammar of C#. However, pre-processing directives can be used to include or exclude sequences of tokens and can in that way affect the meaning of a C# program. [*Example*: When compiled, the program

```csharp
#define A
#undef B

class C
{
#if A
    void F () { }
#else
    void G () { }
#endif

#if B
    void H () { }
#else
    void I () { }
#endif
}
```
results in the exact same sequence of tokens as the program

```csharp
class C
{
    void F() {}
    void I() {}
}
```
Thus, whereas lexically, the two programs are quite different, syntactically, they are identical. *end example*]

### Conditional compilation symbols

The conditional compilation functionality provided by the `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif` directives is controlled through pre-processing expressions (§7.5.3) and conditional compilation symbols.

```antlr
conditional-symbol::
    Any identifier-or-keyword except true or false
```

Two conditional compilation symbols are considered the same if they are identical after the following transformations are applied, in order:

- Each *unicode-escape-sequence* is transformed into its corresponding Unicode character.
- Any *formatting-characters* are removed.

A conditional compilation symbol has two possible states: ***defined*** or ***undefined***. At the beginning of the lexical processing of a source file, a conditional compilation symbol is undefined unless it has been explicitly defined by an external mechanism (such as a command-line compiler option). When a `#define` directive is processed, the conditional compilation symbol named in that directive becomes defined in that source file. The symbol remains defined until a #undef directive for that same symbol is processed, or until the end of the source file is reached. An implication of this is that `#define` and `#undef` directives in one source file have no effect on other source files in the same program.

When referenced in a pre-processing expression (§7.5.3), a defined conditional compilation symbol has the `Boolean` value true, and an undefined conditional compilation symbol has the `Boolean` value false. There is no requirement that conditional compilation symbols be explicitly declared before they are referenced in pre-processing expressions. Instead, undeclared symbols are simply undefined and thus have the value false.

The namespace for conditional compilation symbols is distinct and separate from all other named entities in a C# program. Conditional compilation symbols can only be referenced in `#define` and `#undef` directives and in pre-processing expressions.

### Pre-processing expressions

Pre-processing expressions can occur in `#if` and #elif directives. The operators `!`, `==`, `!=`, `&&`, and `||` are permitted in pre-processing expressions, and parentheses may be used for grouping.

```antlr
pp-expression::
    whitespaceopt pp-or-expression whitespaceopt

pp-or-expression::
    pp-and-expression
    pp-or-expression whitespaceopt || whitespaceopt pp-and-expression

pp-and-expression::
    pp-equality-expression
    pp-and-expression whitespaceopt && whitespaceopt pp-equality-expression

pp-equality-expression::
pp-unary-expression
    pp-equality-expression whitespaceopt == whitespaceopt pp-unary-expression
    pp-equality-expression whitespaceopt != whitespaceopt pp-unary-expression

pp-unary-expression::
    pp-primary-expression
    ! whitespaceopt pp-unary-expression

pp-primary-expression::
    true
    false
    conditional-symbol
    ( whitespaceopt pp-expression whitespaceopt *)*
```

When referenced in a pre-processing expression, a defined conditional compilation symbol has the `Boolean` value true, and an undefined conditional compilation symbol has the `Boolean` value false.

Evaluation of a pre-processing expression always yields a `Boolean` value. The rules of evaluation for a pre-processing expression are the same as those for a constant expression (§12.20), except that the only user-defined entities that can be referenced are conditional compilation symbols.

### Definition directives 

The definition directives are used to define or undefine conditional compilation symbols.

```antlr
pp-declaration::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt define whitespace conditional-symbol pp-new-line
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt undef whitespace conditional-symbol pp-new-line

pp-new-line::
    whitespaceopt single-line-commentopt new-line
```

The processing of a `#define` directive causes the given conditional compilation symbol to become defined, starting with the source line that follows the directive. Likewise, the processing of a `#undef` directive causes the given conditional compilation symbol to become undefined, starting with the source line that follows the directive.

Any `#define` and `#undef` directives in a source file shall occur before the first *token* (§7.4) in the source file; otherwise a compile-time error occurs. In intuitive terms, `#define` and `#undef` directives shall precede any “real code” in the source file.

[*Example*: The example:

```csharp
#define Enterprise

#if Professional || Enterprise
#define Advanced
#endif

namespace Megacorp.Data
{
#if Advanced
    class PivotTable {…}
#endif
}
```
is valid because the #define directives precede the first token (the namespace keyword) in the source file.

*end example*]

[*Example*: The following example results in a compile-time error because a `#define` follows real code:

```csharp
#define A
namespace N
{
#define B
#if B
    class Class1 { }
#endif
}
```
*end example*]

A `#define` may define a conditional compilation symbol that is already defined, without there being any intervening `#undef` for that symbol. [*Example*: The example below defines a conditional compilation symbol A and then defines it again.

```csharp
#define A
#define A
```

For compilers that allow conditional compilation symbols to be defined as compilation options, an alternative way for such redefinition to occur is to define the symbol as a compiler option as well as in the source. *end example*]

A `#undef` may “undefine” a conditional compilation symbol that is not defined. [*Example*: The example below defines a conditional compilation symbol A and then undefines it twice; although the second `#undef` has no effect, it is still valid.

```csharp
#define A
#undef A
#undef A
```
*end example*]

### Conditional compilation directives

The conditional compilation directives are used to conditionally include or exclude portions of a source file.

```antlr
pp-conditional::
    pp-if-section pp-elif-sectionsopt pp-else-sectionopt pp-endif

pp-if-section::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt if whitespace pp-expression pp-new-line
    conditional-sectionopt

pp-elif-sections::
    pp-elif-section
    pp-elif-sections pp-elif-section

pp-elif-section::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt elif whitespace pp-expression pp-new-line
    conditional-sectionopt

pp-else-section::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt else pp-new-line conditional-sectionopt

pp-endif::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt endif pp-new-line

conditional-section::
    input-section
    skipped-section

skipped-section::
    skipped-section-part
    skipped-section skipped-section-part

skipped-section-part::
    skipped-charactersopt new-line
    pp-directive

skipped-characters::
    whitespaceopt not-number-sign input-charactersopt

not-number-sign::
    Any input-character except #
```

> [!NOTE]
> As indicated by the syntax, conditional compilation directives shall be written as sets consisting of, in order, a `#if` directive, zero or more `#elif` directives, zero or one `#else` directive, and a `#endif` directive. Between the directives are conditional sections of source code. Each section is controlled by the immediately preceding directive. A conditional section may itself contain nested conditional compilation directives provided these directives form complete sets. 

A *pp-conditional* selects at most one of the contained *conditional-section*s for normal lexical processing:

- The *pp-expression*s of the `#if` and `#elif` directives are evaluated in order until one yields true. If an expression yields true, the *conditional-section* of the corresponding directive is selected.
- If all *pp-expression*s yield false, and if a `#else` directive is present, the *conditional-section* of the `#else` directive is selected.
- Otherwise, no *conditional-section* is selected.

The selected *conditional-section*, if any, is processed as a normal *input-section*: the source code contained in the section shall adhere to the lexical grammar; tokens are generated from the source code in the section; and pre-processing directives in the section have the prescribed effects.

The remaining *conditional-section*s, if any, are processed as *skipped-section*s: except for pre-processing directives, the source code in the section need not adhere to the lexical grammar; no tokens are generated from the source code in the section; and pre-processing directives in the section shall be lexically correct but are not otherwise processed. Within a *conditional-section* that is being processed as a *skipped-section*, any nested *conditional-section*s (contained in nested `#if`…`#endif` and `#region`…`#endregion` constructs) are also processed as *skipped-section*s.

[*Example*: The following example illustrates how conditional compilation directives can nest:

```csharp
#define Debug // Debugging on
#undef Trace // Tracing off

class PurchaseTransaction
{
    void Commit ()
    {
#if Debug
        CheckConsistency ();
#if Trace
        WriteToLog (this.ToString ());
#endif
#endif
        CommitHelper ();
    }
    …
}
```
Except for pre-processing directives, skipped source code is not subject to lexical analysis. For example, the following is valid despite the unterminated comment in the `#else` section:

```csharp
#define Debug // Debugging on

class PurchaseTransaction
{
    void Commit ()
    {
#if Debug
        CheckConsistency ();
#else
        // Do something else
#endif
    }
    …
}
```

Note, however, that pre-processing directives are required to be lexically correct even in skipped sections of source code.

Pre-processing directives are not processed when they appear inside multi-line input elements. For example, the program:

```csharp
class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine (@"hello,
        #if Debug
            world
        #else
            Nebraska
        #endif
        ");
    }
}
```
results in the output:
```plaintext
hello,
#if Debug
    world
#else
    Nebraska
#endif
```
In peculiar cases, the set of pre-processing directives that is processed might depend on the evaluation of the *pp-expression*. The example:
```csharp
#if X
    /*
#else
    /* */ class Q { }
#endif
```

always produces the same token stream (`class Q { }`), regardless of whether or not X is defined. If X is defined, the only processed directives are `#if` and `#endif`, due to the multi-line comment. If X is undefined, then three directives (`#if`, `#else`, `#endif`) are part of the directive set. *end example*]

### Diagnostic directives

The diagnostic directives are used to generate explicitly error and warning messages that are reported in the same way as other compile-time errors and warnings.

```antlr
pp-diagnostic::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt error pp-message
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt warning pp-message

pp-message::
new-line
    whitespace input-charactersopt new-line
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
#if Debug && Retail
    #error A build can't be both debug and retail
#endif

class Test {…}
```

produces a compile-time error (“A build can’t be both debug and retail”) if the conditional compilation symbols Debug and Retail are both defined. Note that a *pp-message* can contain arbitrary text; specifically, it need not contain well-formed tokens, as shown by the single quote in the word can't. *end example*]

### Region directives

The region directives are used to mark explicitly regions of source code.

```antlr
pp-region::
    pp-start-region conditional-sectionopt pp-end-region

pp-start-region::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt region pp-message

pp-end-region::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt endregion pp-message
```

No semantic meaning is attached to a region; regions are intended for use by the programmer or by automated tools to mark a section of source code. The message specified in a `#region` or `#endregion` directive likewise has no semantic meaning; it merely serves to identify the region. Matching `#region` and `#endregion` directives may have different *pp-message*s.

The lexical processing of a region:

```csharp
#region
…
#endregion
```

corresponds exactly to the lexical processing of a conditional compilation directive of the form:

```csharp
#if true
…
#endif
```

### Line directives

Line directives may be used to alter the line numbers and source file names that are reported by the compiler in output such as warnings and errors. These values are also used by caller-info attributes (§22.5.5).

> [!NOTE]
> Line directives are most commonly used in meta-programming tools that generate C# source code from some other text input.

```antlr
pp-line::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt line whitespace line-indicator pp-new-line

line-indicator::
    decimal-digits whitespace file-name
    decimal-digits
    default
    hidden

file-name::
    " file-name-characters "

file-name-characters::
    file-name-character
file-name-characters file-name-character

file-name-character::
    Any input-character except " (U+0022), and new-line-character
```

When no `#line` directives are present, the compiler reports true line numbers and source file names in its output. When processing a `#line` directive that includes a *line-indicator* that is not default, the compiler treats the line *after* the directive as having the given line number (and file name, if specified).

A `#line` default directive undoes the effect of all preceding `#line` directives. The compiler reports true line information for subsequent lines, precisely as if no `#line` directives had been processed.

A `#line` hidden directive has no effect on the file and line numbers reported in error messages, or produced by use of `CallerLineNumberAttribute` (§22.5.5.2). It is intended to affect source level debugging tools so that, when debugging, all lines between a `#line` hidden directive and the subsequent `#line` directive (that is not `#line` hidden) have no line number information, and are skipped entirely when stepping through code.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that a *file-name* differs from a regular string literal in that escape characters are not processed; the ‘\\’ character simply designates an ordinary backslash character within a *file-name*.

### Pragma directives

The `#pragma` preprocessing directive is used to specify contextual information to a compiler. 
> [!NOTE]
> For example, a compiler might provide `#pragma` directives that
> 
> - Enable or disable particular warning messages when compiling subsequent code. 
> - Specify which optimizations to apply to subsequent code. 
> - Specify information to be used by a debugger.

```antlr
pp-pragma::
    whitespaceopt # whitespaceopt pragma pp-pragma-text

pp-pragma-text::
    new-line
    whitespace input-charactersopt new-line
```

The *input-characters* in the *pp-pragma-text* are interpreted by the compiler in an implementation-defined manner. The information supplied in a `#pragma` directive shall not change program semantics. A `#pragma` directive shall only change compiler behavior that is outside the scope of this language specification. If the compiler cannot interpret the *input-characters*, the compiler can produce a warning; however, it shall not produce a compile-time error.

> [!NOTE]
> *pp-pragma-text* can contain arbitrary text; specifically, it need not contain well-formed tokens.

# Basic concepts

## Application startup

A program may be compiled either as a ***class library*** to be used as part of other applications, or as an ***application*** that may be started directly. The mechanism for determining this mode of compilation is implementation-specific and external to this specification.

A program compiled as an application shall contain at least one method qualifying as an entry point by satisfying the following requirements:

- It shall have the name `Main`.
- It shall be `static`.
- It shall not be generic.
- It shall be declared in a non-generic type. If the type declaring the method is a nested type, none of its enclosing types may be generic.
- It shall not have the `async` modifier.
- The return type shall be `void` or `int`.
- It shall not be a partial method (§15.6.9) without an implementation.
- The formal parameter list shall either be empty, or have a single value parameter of type `string[]`.

If more than one method qualifying as an entry point is declared within a program, an external mechanism may be used to specify which method is deemed to be the actual entry point for the application. It is a compile-time error for a program to be compiled as an application without exactly one entry point. A program compiled as a class library may contain methods that would qualify as application entry points, but the resulting library has no entry point.

Ordinarily, the declared accessibility (§8.5.2) of a method is determined by the access modifiers (§15.3.6) specified in its declaration, and similarly the declared accessibility of a type is determined by the access modifiers specified in its declaration. In order for a given method of a given type to be callable, both the type and the member shall be accessible. However, the application entry point is a special case. Specifically, the execution environment can access the application's entry point regardless of its declared accessibility and regardless of the declared accessibility of its enclosing type declarations.

When an application is run, a new ***application domain*** is created. Several different instantiations of an application may exist on the same machine at the same time, and each has its own application domain.
An application domain enables application isolation by acting as a container for application state. An application domain acts as a container and boundary for the types defined in the application and the class libraries it uses. Types loaded into one application domain are distinct from the same types loaded into another application domain, and instances of objects are not directly shared between application domains. For instance, each application domain has its own copy of static variables for these types, and a static constructor for a type is run at most once per application domain. Implementations are free to provide implementation-specific policy or mechanisms for the creation and destruction of application domains.

Application startup occurs when the execution environment calls the application's entry point. If the entry point declares a parameter, then during application startup, the implementation shall ensure that the initial value of parameter is a non-null reference to a string array. This array shall consist of non-null references to strings, called application parameters, which are given implementation-defined values by the host environment prior to application startup. The intent is to supply to the application information determined prior to application startup from elsewhere in the hosted environment. 
> [!NOTE]
> On systems supporting a command line, application parameters correspond to what are generally known as command-line arguments.

If the entry point's return type is int rather than void, the return value from the method invocation by the execution environment is used in application termination (§8.2).

Other than the situations listed above, entry point methods behave like those that are not entry points in every respect. In particular, if the entry point is invoked at any other point during the application's lifetime, such as by regular method invocation, there is no special handling of the method: if there is a parameter, it may have an initial value of null, or a non-null value referring to an array that contains null references. Likewise, the return value of the entry point has no special significance other than in the invocation from the execution environment.

## Application termination

***Application termination*** returns control to the execution environment.

If the return type of the application’s entry point method is int, the value returned serves as the application's ***termination status code***. The purpose of this code is to allow communication of success or failure to the execution environment.

If the return type of the entry point method is void, reaching the right brace (}) that terminates that method, or executing a return statement that has no expression, results in a termination status code of 0. If the entry point method terminates due to an exception (§21.4), the exit code is implementation-specific. Additionally, the implementation may provide alternative APIs for specifying the exit code.

Prior to an application’s termination, an implementation should make every reasonable effort to call finalizers (§15.13) for all of its objects that have not yet been garbage collected, unless such cleanup has been suppressed (by a call to the library method GC.SuppressFinalize, for example). The implementation should document any conditions under which this behavior cannot be guaranteed.

## Declarations

Declarations in a C# program define the constituent elements of the program. C# programs are organized using namespaces. These are introduced using namespace declarations (§14), which can contain type declarations and nested namespace declarations. Type declarations (§14.7) are used to define classes (§15), structs (§16), interfaces (§18), enums (§19), and delegates (§20). The kinds of members permitted in a type declaration depend on the form of the type declaration. For instance, class declarations can contain declarations for constants (§15.4), fields (§15.5), methods (§15.6), properties (§15.7), events (§15.8), indexers (§15.9), operators (§15.10), instance constructors (§15.11), static constructors (§15.12), finalizers (§15.13), and nested types (§15.3.9).

A declaration defines a name in the ***declaration space*** to which the declaration belongs. It is a compile-time error to have two or more declarations that introduce members with the same name in a declaration space, except in the following cases:

- Two or more namespace declarations with the same name are allowed in the same declaration space. Such namespace declarations are aggregated to form a single logical namespace and share a single declaration space.
- Declarations in separate programs but in the same namespace declaration space are allowed to share the same name. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > However, these declarations could introduce ambiguities if included in the same application.
- Two or more methods with the same name but distinct signatures are allowed in the same declaration space (§8.6).
- Two or more type declarations with the same name but distinct numbers of type parameters are allowed in the same declaration space (§8.8.2).
- Two or more type declarations with the partial modifier in the same declaration space may share the same name, same number of type parameters and same classification (class, struct or interface). In this case, the type declarations contribute to a single type and are themselves aggregated to form a single declaration space (§15.2.7).
- A namespace declaration and a type declaration in the same declaration space can share the same name as long as the type declaration has at least one type parameter (§8.8.2).

There are several different types of declaration spaces, as described in the following.

- Within all source files of a program, *namespace-member-declaration*s with no enclosing *namespace-declaration* are members of a single combined declaration space called the ***global declaration space***.
- Within all source files of a program, *namespace-member-declaration*s within *namespace-declaration*s that have the same fully qualified namespace name are members of a single combined declaration space.
- Each *compilation-unit* and *namespace-body* has an ***alias declaration space***. Each *extern-alias-directive* and *using-alias-directive* of the *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body* contributes a member to the alias declaration space (§14.5.2).
- Each non-partial class, struct, or interface declaration creates a new declaration space. Each partial class, struct, or interface declaration contributes to a declaration space shared by all matching parts in the same program (§16.2.3).Names are introduced into this declaration space through *class-member-declaration*s, *struct-member-declaration*s, *interface-member-declaration*s, or *type-parameter*s. Except for overloaded instance constructor declarations and static constructor declarations, a class or struct cannot contain a member declaration with the same name as the class or struct. A class, struct, or interface permits the declaration of overloaded methods and indexers. Furthermore, a class or struct permits the declaration of overloaded instance constructors and operators. For example, a class, struct, or interface may contain multiple method declarations with the same name, provided these method declarations differ in their signature (§8.6). Note that base classes do not contribute to the declaration space of a class, and base interfaces do not contribute to the declaration space of an interface. Thus, a derived class or interface is allowed to declare a member with the same name as an inherited member. Such a member is said to ***hide*** the inherited member.
- Each delegate declaration creates a new declaration space. Names are introduced into this declaration space through formal parameters (*fixed-parameter*s and *parameter-array*s) and *type-parameter*s.
- Each enumeration declaration creates a new declaration space. Names are introduced into this declaration space through *enum-member-declarations*.
- Each method declaration, property declaration, property accessor declaration, indexer declaration, indexer accessor declaration, operator declaration, instance constructor declaration and anonymous function creates a new declaration space called a ***local variable declaration space***. Names are introduced into this declaration space through formal parameters (*fixed-parameter*s and *parameter-array*s) and *type-parameter*s. The set accessor for a property or an indexer introduces the valuename as a formal parameter. The body of the function member or anonymous function, if any, is considered to be nested within the local variable declaration space. It is an error for a local variable declaration space and a nested local variable declaration space to contain elements with the same name. Thus, within a nested declaration space it is not possible to declare a local variable or constant with the same name as a local variable or constant in an enclosing declaration space. It is possible for two declaration spaces to contain elements with the same name as long as neither declaration space contains the other.
- Each *block* or *switch-block*, as well as a for, foreach, and using statement, creates a local variable declaration space for local variables and local constants. Names are introduced into this declaration space through *local-variable-declaration*s and *local-constant-declaration*s. Note that blocks that occur as or within the body of a function member or anonymous function are nested within the local variable declaration space declared by those functions for their parameters. Thus, it is an error to have, for example, a method with a local variable and a parameter of the same name.
- Each *block* or *switch-block* creates a separate declaration space for labels. Names are introduced into this declaration space through *labeled-statement*s, and the names are referenced through *goto-statement*s. The ***label declaration space*** of a block includes any nested blocks. Thus, within a nested block it is not possible to declare a label with the same name as a label in an enclosing block.

The textual order in which names are declared is generally of no significance. In particular, textual order is not significant for the declaration and use of namespaces, constants, methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, static constructors, and types. Declaration order is significant in the following ways:

- Declaration order for field declarations determines the order in which their initializers (if any) are executed (§15.5.6.2, §15.5.6.3).
- Local variables shall be defined before they are used (§8.7).
- Declaration order for enum member declarations (§19.4) is significant when *constant-expression* values are omitted.

[*Example*: The declaration space of a namespace is “open ended”, and two namespace declarations with the same fully qualified name contribute to the same declaration space. For example

```csharp
namespace Megacorp.Data
{
    class Customer
    {…}
}

namespace Megacorp.Data
{
    class Order
    {…}
}
```

The two namespace declarations above contribute to the same declaration space, in this case declaring two classes with the fully qualified names Megacorp.Data.Customer and Megacorp.Data.Order. Because the two declarations contribute to the same declaration space, it would have caused a compile-time error if each contained a declaration of a class with the same name. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> As specified above, the declaration space of a block includes any nested blocks. Thus, in the following example, the F and G methods result in a compile-time error because the name i is declared in the outer block and cannot be redeclared in the inner block. However, the H and I methods are valid since the two i’s are declared in separate non-nested blocks.

Namespaces and types have ***members***. 
> [!NOTE]
> The members of an entity are generally available through the use of a qualified name that starts with a reference to the entity, followed by a “.” token, followed by the name of the member.

Members of a type are either declared in the type declaration or ***inherited*** from the base class of the type. When a type inherits from a base class, all members of the base class, except instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors become members of the derived type. The declared accessibility of a base class member does not control whether the member is inherited—inheritance extends to any member that isn’t an instance constructor, static constructor, or finalizer. [*Note*: However, an inherited member might not be accessible in a derived type, for example because of its declared accessibility (§8.5.2). *end note*]

### Namespace members

Namespaces and types that have no enclosing namespace are members of the ***global namespace***. This corresponds directly to the names declared in the global declaration space.

Namespaces and types declared within a namespace are members of that namespace. This corresponds directly to the names declared in the declaration space of the namespace.

Namespaces have no access restrictions. It is not possible to declare private, protected, or internal namespaces, and namespace names are always publicly accessible.

### Struct members

The members of a struct are the members declared in the struct and the members inherited from the struct’s direct base class `System.ValueType` and the indirect base class object.

The members of a simple type correspond directly to the members of the struct type aliased by the simple type (§9.3.5).

### Enumeration members

The members of an enumeration are the constants declared in the enumeration and the members inherited from the enumeration’s direct base class `System.Enum` and the indirect base classes `System.ValueType` and object.

### Class members

The members of a class are the members declared in the class and the members inherited from the base class (except for class object which has no base class). The members inherited from the base class include the constants, fields, methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, and types of the base class, but not the instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors of the base class. Base class members are inherited without regard to their accessibility.

A class declaration may contain declarations of constants, fields, methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, static constructors, and types.

The members of object (§9.2.3) and string (§9.2.5) correspond directly to the members of the class types they alias.

### Interface members

The members of an interface are the members declared in the interface and in all base interfaces of the interface. 
> [!NOTE]
> The members in class object are not, strictly speaking, members of any interface (§18.4). However, the members in class object are available via member lookup in any interface type (§12.5).

### Array members

The members of an array are the members inherited from class `System.Array`.

### Delegate members

A delegate inherits members from class `System.Delegate`. Additionally, it contains a method named `Invoke` with the same return type and formal parameter list specified in its declaration (§20.2). An invocation of this method shall behave identically to a delegate invocation (§20.6) on the same delegate instance.

An implementation may provide additional members, either through inheritance or directly in the delegate itself.

## Member access

### General

Declarations of members allow control over member access. The accessibility of a member is established by the declared accessibility (§8.5.2) of the member combined with the accessibility of the immediately containing type, if any.

When access to a particular member is allowed, the member is said to be ***accessible.*** Conversely, when access to a particular member is disallowed, the member is said to be ***inaccessible***. Access to a member is permitted when the textual location in which the access takes place is included in the accessibility domain (§8.5.3) of the member.

### Declared accessibility

The ***declared accessibility*** of a member can be one of the following:

- `Public`, which is selected by including a public modifier in the member declaration. The intuitive meaning of public is “access not limited”.
- `Protected`, which is selected by including a protected modifier in the member declaration. The intuitive meaning of protected is “access limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class”.
- `Internal`, which is selected by including an internal modifier in the member declaration. The intuitive meaning of internal is “access limited to this assembly”.
- `Protected internal`, which is selected by including both a protected and an internal modifier in the member declaration. The intuitive meaning of protected internal is “accessible within this assembly as well as types derived from the containing class”.
- `Private`, which is selected by including a private modifier in the member declaration. The intuitive meaning of private is “access limited to the containing type”.

Depending on the context in which a member declaration takes place, only certain types of declared accessibility are permitted. Furthermore, when a member declaration does not include any access modifiers, the context in which the declaration takes place determines the default declared accessibility.

- Namespaces implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on namespace declarations.
- Types declared directly in compilation units or namespaces (as opposed to within other types) can have public or internal declared accessibility and default to internal declared accessibility.
- Class members can have any of the five kinds of declared accessibility and default to private declared accessibility.
  > [!NOTE]
  > A type declared as a member of a class can have any of the five kinds of declared accessibility, whereas a type declared as a member of a namespace can have only public or internal declared accessibility.
- Struct members can have public, internal, or private declared accessibility and default to private declared accessibility because structs are implicitly sealed. Struct members introduced in a struct (that is, not inherited by that struct) cannot have protected or protected internal declared accessibility. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > A type declared as a member of a struct can have public, internal, or private declared accessibility, whereas a type declared as a member of a namespace can have only public or internal declared accessibility.
- Interface members implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on interface member declarations.
- Enumeration members implicitly have public declared accessibility. No access modifiers are allowed on enumeration member declarations.

### Accessibility domains

The ***accessibility domain*** of a member consists of the (possibly disjoint) sections of program text in which access to the member is permitted. For purposes of defining the accessibility domain of a member, a member is said to be ***top-level*** if it is not declared within a type, and a member is said to be ***nested*** if it is declared within another type. Furthermore, the ***program text*** of a program is defined as all program text contained in all source files of the program, and the program text of a type is defined as all program text contained in the *type-declaration*s of that type (including, possibly, types that are nested within the type).

The accessibility domain of a predefined type (such as `object`, `int`, or `double`) is unlimited.

The accessibility domain of a top-level unbound type T (§9.4.4) that is declared in a program P is defined as follows:

- If the declared accessibility of T is public, the accessibility domain of T is the program text of P and any program that references P.
- If the declared accessibility of T is internal, the accessibility domain of T is the program text of P.

> [!NOTE]
> From these definitions, it follows that the accessibility domain of a top-level unbound type is always at least the program text of the program in which that type is declared.

The accessibility domain for a constructed type `T<A1, …,AN>` is the intersection of the accessibility domain of the unbound generic type `T` and the accessibility domains of the type arguments `A1, …,AN`.

The accessibility domain of a nested member M declared in a type T within a program P, is defined as follows (noting that M itself might possibly be a type):

- If the declared accessibility of M is `public`, the accessibility domain of M is the accessibility domain of T.
- If the declared accessibility of M is `protected internal`, let D be the union of the program text of P and the program text of any type derived from T, which is declared outside P. The accessibility domain of M is the intersection of the accessibility domain of T with D.
- If the declared accessibility of M is `protected`, let D be the union of the program text of T and the program text of any type derived from T. The accessibility domain of M is the intersection of the accessibility domain of T with D.
- If the declared accessibility of M is `internal`, the accessibility domain of M is the intersection of the accessibility domain of T with the program text of P.
- If the declared accessibility of M is `private`, the accessibility domain of M is the program text of T.

> [!NOTE]
> IFrom these definitions it follows that the accessibility domain of a nested member is always at least the program text of the type in which the member is declared. Furthermore, it follows that the accessibility domain of a member is never more inclusive than the accessibility domain of the type in which the member is declared.

> [!NOTE]
> In intuitive terms, when a type or member M is accessed, the following steps are evaluated to ensure that the access is permitted:
> 
> - First, if M is declared within a type (as opposed to a compilation unit or a namespace), a compile-time error occurs if that type is not accessible.
> - Then, if M is public, the access is permitted.
> - Otherwise, if M is protected internal, the access is permitted if it occurs within the program in which M is declared, or if it occurs within a class derived from the class in which M is declared and takes place through the derived class type (§8.5.4).
> - Otherwise, if M is protected, the access is permitted if it occurs within the class in which M is declared, or if it occurs within a class derived from the class in which M is declared and takes place through the derived class type (§8.5.4).
> - Otherwise, if M is internal, the access is permitted if it occurs within the program in which M is declared.
> - Otherwise, if M is private, the access is permitted if it occurs within the type in which M is declared.
> - Otherwise, the type or member is inaccessible, and a compile-time error occurs.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public class A
{
    public static int X;
    internal static int Y;
    private static int Z;
}

internal class B
{
    public static int X;
    internal static int Y;
    private static int Z;

    public class C
    {
        public static int X;
        internal static int Y;
        private static int Z;
    }

    private class D
    {
        public static int X;
        internal static int Y;
        private static int Z;
    }
}
```

the classes and members have the following accessibility domains:

- The accessibility domain of `A` and `A.X` is unlimited.
- The accessibility domain of `A.Y`, `B`, `B.X`, `B.Y`, `B.C`, `B.C.X`, and `B.C.Y` is the program text of the containing program.
- The accessibility domain of `A.Z` is the program text of `A`.
- The accessibility domain of `B.Z` and B.D is the program text of `B`, including the program text of `B.C` and `B.D`.
- The accessibility domain of `B.C.Z` is the program text of `B.C`.
- The accessibility domain of `B.D.X` and `B.D.Y` is the program text of `B`, including the program text of `B.C` and `B.D`.
- The accessibility domain of `B.D.Z` is the program text of `B.D`.

As the example illustrates, the accessibility domain of a member is never larger than that of a containing type. For example, even though all X members have public declared accessibility, all but `A.X` have accessibility domains that are constrained by a containing type. *end example*]

As described in §8.4, all members of a base class, except for instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors, are inherited by derived types. This includes even private members of a base class. However, the accessibility domain of a private member includes only the program text of the type in which the member is declared. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    int x;
    static void F (B b)
    {
        b.x = 1; // Ok
    }
}

class B : A
{
    static void F (B b)
    {
        b.x = 1; // Error, x not accessible
    }
}
```
the `B` class inherits the private member `x` from the `A` class. Because the member is private, it is only accessible within the *class-body* of `A`. Thus, the access to `b.x` succeeds in the `A.F` method, but fails in the `B.F` method. *end example*]

### Protected access

When a protected instance member is accessed outside the program text of the class in which it is declared, and when a protected internal instance member is accessed outside the program text of the program in which it is declared, the access shall take place within a class declaration that derives from the class in which it is declared. Furthermore, the access is required to take place *through* an instance of that derived class type or a class type constructed from it. This restriction prevents one derived class from accessing protected members of other derived classes, even when the members are inherited from the same base class.

Let `B` be a base class that declares a protected instance member `M`, and let `D` be a class that derives from `B`. Within the *class-body* of `D`, access to `M` can take one of the following forms:

- An unqualified *type-name* or *primary-expression* of the form `M`.
- A *primary-expression* of the form `E.M`, provided the type of `E` is `T` or a class derived from `T`, where `T` is the class `D`, or a class type constructed from `D`.
- A *primary-expression* of the form `base.M`.

In addition to these forms of access, a derived class can access a protected instance constructor of a base class in a *constructor-initializer* (§15.11.2).

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public class A
{
    protected int x;

    static void F (A a, B b)
    {
        a.x = 1; // Ok
        b.x = 1; // Ok
    }
}

public class B : A
{
    static void F (A a, B b)
    {
        a.x = 1; // Error, must access through instance of B
        b.x = 1; // Ok
    }
}
```
within `A`, it is possible to access x through instances of both `A` and `B`, since in either case the access takes place *through* an instance of `A` or a class derived from `A`. However, within `B`, it is not possible to access x through an instance of `A`, since A does not derive from `B`. *end example*]

[*Example*:
```csharp
class C<T>
{
    protected T x;
}

class D<T> : C<T>
{
    static void F ()
    {
        D<T> dt = new D<T> ();
        D<int> di = new D<int> ();
        D<string> ds = new D<string> ();
        dt.x = default (T);
        di.x = 123;
        ds.x = "test";
    }
}
```
Here, the three assignments to `x` are permitted because they all take place through instances of class types constructed from the generic type. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> The accessibility domain (§8.5.3) of a protected member declared in a generic class includes the program text of all class declarations derived from any type constructed from that generic class. In the example:
> 
> ```csharp
> class C<T>
> {
>     protected static T x;
> }
> 
> class D : C<string>
> {
>     static void Main()
>     {
>         C<int>.x = 5;
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> the reference to protected member `C<int>.x` in `D` is valid even though the class `D` derives from `C<string>`.

### Accessibility constraints

Several constructs in the C# language require a type to be ***at least as accessible as*** a member or another type. A type `T` is said to be at least as accessible as a member or type `M` if the accessibility domain of `T` is a superset of the accessibility domain of `M`. In other words, `T` is at least as accessible as `M` if `T` is accessible in all contexts in which `M` is accessible.

The following accessibility constraints exist:

- The direct base class of a class type shall be at least as accessible as the class type itself.
- The explicit base interfaces of an interface type shall be at least as accessible as the interface type itself.
- The return type and parameter types of a delegate type shall be at least as accessible as the delegate type itself.
- The type of a constant shall be at least as accessible as the constant itself.
- The type of a field shall be at least as accessible as the field itself.
- The return type and parameter types of a method shall be at least as accessible as the method itself.
- The type of a property shall be at least as accessible as the property itself.
- The type of an event shall be at least as accessible as the event itself.
- The type and parameter types of an indexer shall be at least as accessible as the indexer itself.
- The return type and parameter types of an operator shall be at least as accessible as the operator itself.
- The parameter types of an instance constructor shall be at least as accessible as the instance constructor itself.

[*Example*: In the following code
```csharp
class A {…}

public class B: A {…}
```
the `B` class results in a compile-time error because `A` is not at least as accessible as `B`. *end example*]

[*Example*: Likewise, in the following code
```csharp
class A {…}

public class B
{
    A F () {…}
    internal A G () {…}
    public A H () {…}
}
```
the `H` method in `B` results in a compile-time error because the return type `A` is not at least as accessible as the method. *end example*]

## Signatures and overloading

Methods, instance constructors, indexers, and operators are characterized by their ***signatures***:

- The signature of a method consists of the name of the method, the number of type parameters, and the type and parameter-passing mode (value, reference, or output) of each of its formal parameters, considered in the order left to right. For these purposes, any type parameter of the method that occurs in the type of a formal parameter is identified not by its name, but by its ordinal position in the type parameter list of the method. The signature of a method specifically does not include the return type, parameter names, type parameter names, type parameter constraints, the params or this parameter modifiers, nor whether parameters are required or optional.
- The signature of an instance constructor consists of the type and parameter-passing mode (value, reference, or output) of each of its formal parameters, considered in the order left to right. The signature of an instance constructor specifically does not include the params modifier that may be specified for the right-most parameter.
- The signature of an indexer consists of the type of each of its formal parameters, considered in the order left to right. The signature of an indexer specifically does not include the element type, nor does it include the params modifier that may be specified for the right-most parameter.
- The signature of an operator consists of the name of the operator and the type of each of its formal parameters, considered in the order left to right. The signature of an operator specifically does not include the result type.
- The signature of a conversion operator consists of the source type and the target type. The implicit or explicit classification of a conversion operator is not part of the signature.
- Two signatures of the same member kind (method, instance constructor, indexer or operator) are considered to be the *same signatures* if they have the same name, number of type parameters, number of parameters, and parameter-passing modes, and an identity conversion exists between the types of their corresponding parameters (§11.2.2).

Signatures are the enabling mechanism for ***overloading*** of members in classes, structs, and interfaces:

- Overloading of methods permits a class, struct, or interface to declare multiple methods with the same name, provided their signatures are unique within that class, struct, or interface.
- Overloading of instance constructors permits a class or struct to declare multiple instance constructors, provided their signatures are unique within that class or struct.
- Overloading of indexers permits a class, struct, or interface to declare multiple indexers, provided their signatures are unique within that class, struct, or interface.
- Overloading of operators permits a class or struct to declare multiple operators with the same name, provided their signatures are unique within that class or struct.

Although `out` and `ref` parameter modifiers are considered part of a signature, members declared in a single type cannot differ in signature solely by `ref` and `out`. A compile-time error occurs if two members are declared in the same type with signatures that would be the same if all parameters in both methods with `out` modifiers were changed to `ref` modifiers. For other purposes of signature matching (e.g., hiding or overriding), `ref` and `out` are considered part of the signature and do not match each other. 
> [!NOTE]
> This restriction is to allow C# programs to be easily translated to run on the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which does not provide a way to define methods that differ solely in `ref` and `out`.

The types `object` and `dynamic` are not distinguished when comparing signatures. Therefore members declared in a single type whose signatures differ only by replacing `object` with `dynamic` are not allowed.

[*Example*: The following example shows a set of overloaded method declarations along with their signatures.
```csharp
interface ITest
{
    void F (); // F()
    void F (int x); // F(int)
    void F (ref int x); // F(ref int)
    void F (out int x); // F(out int) error

    void F (object o); // F(object)
    void F (dynamic d); // error.

    void F (int x, int y); // F(int, int)
    int F (string s); // F(string)
    int F (int x); // F(int) error

    void F (string[] a); // F(string[])
    void F (params string[] a); // F(string[]) error

    void F<S> (S s); // F<\`0>(\`0)
    void F<T> (T t); // F<\`0>(\`0) error

    void F<S, T> (S s); // F<\`0,\`1>(\`0)
    void F<T, S> (S s); // F<\`0,\`1>(\`1) ok
}
```
Note that any `ref` and `out` parameter modifiers (§15.6.2) are part of a signature. Thus, `F(int)`, `F(ref int)`, and `F(out int)` are all unique signatures. However, `F(ref int)` and `F(out int)` cannot be declared within the same interface because their signatures differ solely by ref and out. Also, note that the return type and the params modifier are not part of a signature, so it is not possible to overload solely based on return type or on the inclusion or exclusion of the params modifier. As such, the declarations of the methods `F(int)` and `F(params string[])` identified above, result in a compile-time error. *end example*]

## Scopes

### General

The ***scope*** of a name is the region of program text within which it is possible to refer to the entity declared by the name without qualification of the name. Scopes can be ***nested***, and an inner scope may redeclare the meaning of a name from an outer scope. (This does not, however, remove the restriction imposed by §8.3 that within a nested block it is not possible to declare a local variable or local constant with the same name as a local variable or local constant in an enclosing block.) The name from the outer scope is then said to be ***hidden*** in the region of program text covered by the inner scope, and access to the outer name is only possible by qualifying the name.

- The scope of a namespace member declared by a *namespace-member-declaration* (§14.6) with no enclosing *namespace-declaration* is the entire program text.
- The scope of a namespace member declared by a *namespace-member-declaration* within a *namespace-declaration* whose fully qualified name is N`, is the *namespace-body* of every *namespace-declaration* whose fully qualified name is `N` or starts with `N`, followed by a period.
- The scope of a name defined by an *extern-alias-directive* (§14.4) extends over the *using-directives*, *global-attributes* and *namespace-member-declarations* of its immediately containing *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body*. An *extern-alias-directive* does not contribute any new members to the underlying declaration space. In other words, an *extern-alias-directive* is not transitive, but, rather, affects only the *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body* in which it occurs.
- The scope of a name defined or imported by a *using-directive* (§14.5) extends over the *global-attributes* and *namespace-member-declarations* of the *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body* in which the *using-directive* occurs. A *using-directive* may make zero or more namespace or type names available within a particular *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body*, but does not contribute any new members to the underlying declaration space. In other words, a *using-directive* is not transitive but rather affects only the *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body* in which it occurs.
- The scope of a type parameter declared by a *type-parameter-list* on a *class-declaration* (§15.2) is the *class-base*, *type-parameter-constraints-clauses*, and *class-body* of that *class-declaration*. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > Unlike members of a class, this scope does not extend to derived classes.
- The scope of a type parameter declared by a *type-parameter-list* on a *struct-declaration* (§16.2) is the *struct-interfaces*, *type-parameter-constraints-clauses*, and *struct-body* of that *struct-declaration*.
- The scope of a type parameter declared by a *type-parameter-list* on an *interface-declaration* (§18.2) is the *interface-base*, *type-parameter-constraints-clauses*, and *interface-body* of that *interface-declaration*.
- The scope of a type parameter declared by a *type-parameter-list* on a *delegate-declaration* (§20.2) is the *return-type*, *formal-parameter-list*, and *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* of that *delegate-declaration*.
- The scope of a type parameter declared by a *type-parameter-list* on a *method-declaration* (§15.6.1) is the *method-declaration*.
- The scope of a member declared by a *class-member-declaration* (§15.3.1) is the *class-body* in which the declaration occurs. In addition, the scope of a class member extends to the *class-body* of those derived classes that are included in the accessibility domain (§8.5.3) of the member.
- The scope of a member declared by a *struct-member-declaration* (§16.3) is the *struct-body* in which the declaration occurs.
- The scope of a member declared by an *enum-member-declaration* (§19.4) is the *enum-body* in which the declaration occurs.
- The scope of a parameter declared in a *method-declaration* (§15.6) is the *method-body* of that *method-declaration*.
- The scope of a parameter declared in an *indexer-declaration* (§15.9) is the *accessor-declarations* of that *indexer-declaration*.
- The scope of a parameter declared in an *operator-declaration* (§15.10) is the *block* of that *operator-declaration*.
- The scope of a parameter declared in a *constructor-declaration* (§15.11) is the *constructor-initializer* and *block* of that *constructor-declaration*.
- The scope of a parameter declared in a *lambda-expression* (§12.16) is the *lambda-expression-body* of that *lambda-expression*.
- The scope of a parameter declared in an *anonymous-method-expression* (§12.16) is the *block* of that *anonymous-method-expression*.
- The scope of a label declared in a *labeled-statement* (§13.5) is the *block* in which the declaration occurs.
- The scope of a local variable declared in a *local-variable-declaration* (§13.6.2) is the *block* in which the declaration occurs.
- The scope of a local variable declared in a *switch-block* of a switch statement (§13.8.3) is the *switch-block*.
- The scope of a local variable declared in a *for-initializer* of a for statement (§13.9.4) is the *for-initializer*, the *for-condition*, the *for-iterator*, and the contained *statement* of the for statement.
- The scope of a local constant declared in a *local-constant-declaration* (§13.6.3) is the *block* in which the declaration occurs. It is a compile-time error to refer to a local constant in a textual position that precedes its *constant-declarator*.
- The scope of a variable declared as part of a *foreach-statement*, *using-statement*, *lock-statement* or *query-expression* is determined by the expansion of the given construct.

Within the scope of a namespace, class, struct, or enumeration member it is possible to refer to the member in a textual position that precedes the declaration of the member. [*Example*:
```csharp
class A
{
    void F ()
    {
        i = 1;
    }
    int i = 0;
}
```
Here, it is valid for `F` to refer to `i` before it is declared. *end example*]

Within the scope of a local variable, it is a compile-time error to refer to the local variable in a textual position that precedes the *local-variable-declarator* of the local variable. [*Example*:
```csharp
class A
{
    int i = 0;

    void F ()
    {
        i = 1; // Error, use precedes declaration
        int i;
        i = 2;
    }

    void G ()
    {
        int j = (j = 1); // Valid
    }

    void H ()
    {
        int a = 1, b = ++a; // Valid
    }
}
```
In the `F` method above, the first assignment to i specifically does not refer to the field declared in the outer scope. Rather, it refers to the local variable and it results in a compile-time error because it textually precedes the declaration of the variable. In the `G` method, the use of `j` in the initializer for the declaration of `j` is valid because the use does not precede the *local-variable-declarator*. In the `H` method, a subsequent *local-variable-declarator* correctly refers to a local variable declared in an earlier *local-variable-declarator* within the same *local-variable-declaration*. *end example*]

The scoping rules for local variables and local constants are designed to guarantee that the meaning of a name used in an expression context is always the same within a block. If the scope of a local variable were to extend only from its declaration to the end of the block, then in the example above, the first assignment would assign to the instance variable and the second assignment would assign to the local variable, possibly leading to compile-time errors if the statements of the block were later to be rearranged.)

> [!NOTE]
> The meaning of a name within a block may differ based on the context in which the name is used. In the example
> ```csharp
> using System;
> 
> class A { }
> 
> class Test
> {
>     static void Main()
>     {
>         string A = "hello, world";
>         string s = A; // expression context
> 
>         Type t = typeof (A); // type context
> 
>         Console.WriteLine (s); // writes "hello, world"
>         Console.WriteLine (t); // writes "A"
>     }
> }
> ```
> the name `A` is used in an expression context to refer to the local variable `A` and in a type context to refer to the class `A`.

### Name hiding

#### General

The scope of an entity typically encompasses more program text than the declaration space of the entity. In particular, the scope of an entity may include declarations that introduce new declaration spaces containing entities of the same name. Such declarations cause the original entity to become ***hidden***. Conversely, an entity is said to be ***visible*** when it is not hidden.

Name hiding occurs when scopes overlap through nesting and when scopes overlap through inheritance. The characteristics of the two types of hiding are described in the following subclauses.

#### Hiding through nesting

Name hiding through nesting can occur as a result of nesting namespaces or types within namespaces, as a result of nesting types within classes or structs, and as a result of parameter, local variable, and local constant declarations. [*Example*: In the following code
```csharp
class A
{
    int i = 0;

    void F ()
    {
        int i = 1;
    }

    void G ()
    {
        i = 1;
    }
}
```
within the `F` method, the instance variable `i` is hidden by the local variable `i`, but within the `G` method, `i` still refers to the instance variable. *end example*]

When a name in an inner scope hides a name in an outer scope, it hides all overloaded occurrences of that name. [*Example*: In the following code
```csharp
class Outer
{
    static void F (int i) { }

    static void F (string s) { }

    class Inner
    {
        static void F (long l) { }
        void G ()
        {
            F (1); // Invokes Outer.Inner.F
            F ("Hello"); // Error
        }

    }
}
```
the call `F(1)` invokes the `F` declared in Inner because all outer occurrences of `F` are hidden by the inner declaration. For the same reason, the call `F("Hello")` results in a compile-time error. *end example*]

#### Hiding through inheritance

Name hiding through inheritance occurs when classes or structs redeclare names that were inherited from base classes. This type of name hiding takes one of the following forms:

- A constant, field, property, event, or type introduced in a class or struct hides all base class members with the same name.
- A method introduced in a class or struct hides all non-method base class members with the same name, and all base class methods with the same signature (§8.6).
- An indexer introduced in a class or struct hides all base class indexers with the same signature (§8.6) .

The rules governing operator declarations (§15.10) make it impossible for a derived class to declare an operator with the same signature as an operator in a base class. Thus, operators never hide one another.

Contrary to hiding a name from an outer scope, hiding a visible name from an inherited scope causes a warning to be reported. [*Example*: In the following code
```csharp
class Base
{
    public void F () { }
}

class Derived : Base
{
    public void F () { } // Warning, hiding an inherited name
}
```
the declaration of `F` in `Derived` causes a warning to be reported. Hiding an inherited name is specifically not an error, since that would preclude separate evolution of base classes. For example, the above situation might have come about because a later version of `Base` introduced an `F` method that wasn’t present in an earlier version of the class. *end example*]

The warning caused by hiding an inherited name can be eliminated through use of the new modifier: [*Example*:
```csharp
class Base
{
    public void F () { }
}

class Derived : Base
{
    new public void F () { }
}
```
The `new` modifier indicates that the `F` in `Derived` is “`new`”, and that it is indeed intended to hide the inherited member. *end example*]

A declaration of a `new` member hides an inherited member only within the scope of the `new` member. [*Example*:
```csharp
class Base
{
    public static void F () { }
}

class Derived : Base
{
    new private static void F () { } // Hides Base.F in Derived only
}

class MoreDerived : Derived
{
    static void G () { F (); } // Invokes Base.F
}
```
In the example above, the declaration of `F` in `Derived` hides the `F` that was inherited from `Base`, but since the `new F` in `Derived` has private access, its scope does not extend to `MoreDerived`. Thus, the call `F()` in `MoreDerived.G` is valid and will invoke `Base.F`. *end example*]

## Namespace and type names

### General

Several contexts in a C# program require a *namespace-name* or a *type-name* to be specified.

```antlr
namespace-name:
    namespace-or-type-name

type-name:
    namespace-or-type-name

namespace-or-type-name:
    identifier type-argument-listopt
    namespace-or-type-name . identifier type-argument-listopt
    qualified-alias-member
```

A *namespace-name* is a *namespace-or-type-name* that refers to a namespace.

Following resolution as described below, the *namespace-or-type-name* of a *namespace-name* shall refer to a namespace, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs. No type arguments (§9.4.2) can be present in a *namespace-name* (only types can have type arguments).

A *type-name* is a *namespace-or-type-name* that refers to a type. Following resolution as described below, the *namespace-or-type-name* of a *type-name* shall refer to a type, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

If the *namespace-or-type-name* is a *qualified-alias-member* its meaning is as described in §14.8.1. Otherwise, a *namespace-or-type-name* has one of four forms:

- `I`
- `I<A1, …, AK>`
- `N.I`
- `N.I<A1, …, AK>`

where `I` is a single identifier, `N` is a *namespace-or-type-name* and `<A1, …, AK>` is an optional *type-argument-list*. When no *type-argument-list* is specified, consider `K` to be zero.

The meaning of a *namespace-or-type-name* is determined as follows:

- If the *namespace-or-type-name* is a *qualified-alias-member*, the meaning is as specified in §14.8.1.
- Otherwise, if the *namespace-or-type-name* is of the form `I` or of the form `I<A1, …, AK>`:
  - If `K` is zero and the *namespace-or-type-name* appears within a generic method declaration (§15.6) but outside the *attributes* of its *method-header,* and if that declaration includes a type parameter (§15.2.3) with name `I`, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that type parameter.
  - Otherwise, if the *namespace-or-type-name* appears within a type declaration, then for each instance type `T` (§15.3.2), starting with the instance type of that type declaration and continuing with the instance type of each enclosing class or struct declaration (if any):
    - If `K` is zero and the declaration of `T` includes a type parameter with name `I`, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that type parameter.
    - Otherwise, if the *namespace-or-type-name* appears within the body of the type declaration, and `T` or any of its base types contain a nested accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments. If there is more than one such type, the type declared within the more derived type is selected. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > Non-type members (constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors) and type members with a different number of type parameters are ignored when determining the meaning of the *namespace-or-type-name*.
  - Otherwise, for each namespace `N`, starting with the namespace in which the *namespace-or-type-name* occurs, continuing with each enclosing namespace (if any), and ending with the global namespace, the following steps are evaluated until an entity is located:
    - If `K` is zero and `I` is the name of a namespace in `N`, then:
      - If the location where the *namespace-or-type-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for N and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with a namespace or type, then the *namespace-or-type-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
      - Otherwise, the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to the namespace named `I` in `N`.
    - Otherwise, if `N` contains an accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then:
      - If `K` is zero and the location where the *namespace-or-type-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N` and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with a namespace or type, then the *namespace-or-type-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
      - Otherwise, the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to the type constructed with the given type arguments.
    - Otherwise, if the location where the *namespace-or-type-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N`:
      - If `K` is zero and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name I with an imported namespace or type, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that namespace or type.
      - Otherwise, if the namespaces imported by the *using-namespace-directive*s of the namespace declaration contain exactly one type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments.
    - Otherwise, if the namespaces imported by the *using-namespace-directive*s of the namespace declaration contain more than one type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *namespace-or-type-name* is ambiguous and an error occurs.
  - Otherwise, the *namespace-or-type-name* is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, the *namespace-or-type-name* is of the form `N.I` or of the form `N.I<A1, …, AK>`. N is first resolved as a *namespace-or-type-name*. If the resolution of `N` is not successful, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, `N.I` or `N.I<A1, …, AK>` is resolved as follows:
  - If `K` is zero and `N` refers to a namespace and `N` contains a nested namespace with name I`, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that nested namespace.
  - Otherwise, if `N` refers to a namespace and `N` contains an accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments.
  - Otherwise, if `N` refers to a (possibly constructed) class or struct type and `N` or any of its base classes contain a nested accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments. If there is more than one such type, the type declared within the more derived type is selected. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > IIf the meaning of `N.I` is being determined as part of resolving the base class specification of `N` then the direct base class of `N` is considered to be object (§15.2.4.2). *end note*]
  - Otherwise, `N.I `is an invalid *namespace-or-type-name*, and a compile-time error occurs.

A *namespace-or-type-name* is permitted to reference a static class (§15.2.2.4) only if

- The *namespace-or-type-name* is the `T` in a *namespace-or-type-name* of the form `T.I`, or
- The *namespace-or-type-name* is the `T` in a *typeof-expression* (§12.7.12) of the form typeof(T)

### Unqualified names

Every namespace declaration and type declaration has an ***unqualified name*** determined as follows:

- For a namespace declaration, the unqualified name is the *qualified-identifier* specified in the declaration.
- For a type declaration with no *type-parameter-list*, the unqualified name is the *identifier* specified in the declaration.
- For a type declaration with `K` type parameters, the unqualified name is the *identifier* specified in the declaration, followed by the *generic-dimension-specifier* (§12.7.12) for `K` type parameters.

###  Fully qualified names

Every namespace and type declaration has a ***fully qualified name,*** which uniquely identifies the namespace or type declaration amongst all others within the program. The fully qualified name of a namespace or type declaration with unqualified name `N` is determined as follows:

- If `N` is a member of the global namespace, its fully qualified name is `N`.
- Otherwise, its fully qualified name is `S.N`, where `S` is the fully qualified name of the namespace or type declaration in which `N` is declared.

In other words, the fully qualified name of `N` is the complete hierarchical path of identifiers and *generic-dimension-specifier*s that lead to N, starting from the global namespace. Because every member of a namespace or type shall have a unique name, it follows that the fully qualified name of a namespace or type declaration is always unique. It is a compile-time error for the same fully qualified name to refer to two distinct entities. In particular:

- It is an error for both a namespace declaration and a type declaration to have the same fully qualified name.
- It is an error for two different kinds of type declarations to have the same fully qualified name (for example, if both a struct and class declaration have the same fully qualified name).
- It is an error for a type declaration without the partial modifier to have the same fully qualified name as another type declaration (§15.2.7).

[*Example*: The example below shows several namespace and type declarations along with their associated fully qualified names.
```csharp
class A { } // A

namespace X // X
{
    class B // X.B
    {
        class C { } // X.B.C
    }

    namespace Y // X.Y
    {
        class D { } // X.Y.D
    }
}

namespace X.Y // X.Y
{
    class E { } // X.Y.E

    class G<T>
    { // X.Y.G<>
        class H { } // X.Y.G<>.H
    }

    class G<S, T>
    { // X.Y.G<,>
        class H<U> { } // X.Y.G<,>.H<>
    }
}
```
*end example*]

## Automatic memory management

C# employs automatic memory management, which frees developers from manually allocating and freeing the memory occupied by objects. Automatic memory management policies are implemented by a garbage collector. The memory management life cycle of an object is as follows:

1.  When the object is created, memory is allocated for it, the constructor is run, and the object is considered ***live***.
2.  If neither the object nor any of its instance fields can be accessed by any possible continuation of execution, other than the running of finalizers, the object is considered ***no longer in use*** and it becomes eligible for finalization.
  > [!NOTE]
  > The C# compiler and the garbage collector might choose to analyze code to determine which references to an object might be used in the future. For instance, if a local variable that is in scope is the only existing reference to an object, but that local variable is never referred to in any possible continuation of execution from the current execution point in the procedure, the garbage collector might (but is not required to) treat the object as no longer in use. 
3.  Once the object is eligible for finalization, at some unspecified later time the finalizer (§15.13) (if any) for the object is run. Under normal circumstances the finalizer for the object is run once only, though implementation-specific APIs may allow this behavior to be overridden.
4.  Once the finalizer for an object is run, if neither the object nor any of its instance fields can be accessed by any possible continuation of execution, including the running of finalizers, the object is considered ***inaccessible*** and the object becomes eligible for collection. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > IAn object which could previously not be accessed may become accessible again due to its finalizer. An example of this is provided below.
5.  Finally, at some time after the object becomes eligible for collection, the garbage collector frees the memory associated with that object.

The garbage collector maintains information about object usage, and uses this information to make memory management decisions, such as where in memory to locate a newly created object, when to relocate an object, and when an object is no longer in use or inaccessible.

Like other languages that assume the existence of a garbage collector, C# is designed so that the garbage collector might implement a wide range of memory management policies. C# requires that finalizers be run at some time between the time an object is eligible and the time that the application exits, but specifies neither a time constraint within that span, nor an order in which finalizers are run.

The behavior of the garbage collector can be controlled, to some degree, via static methods on the class System.GC. This class can be used to request a collection to occur, finalizers to be run (or not run), and so forth.

[*Example*: Since the garbage collector is allowed wide latitude in deciding when to collect objects and run finalizers, a conforming implementation might produce output that differs from that shown by the following code. The program
```csharp
using System;

class A
{\
    ~A ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Finalize instance of A");
    }
}

class B
{
    object Ref;
    public B (object o)
    {
        Ref = o;
    }\
    ~B ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Finalize instance of B");
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b = new B (new A ());
        b = null;
        GC.Collect ();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers ();
    }
}
```
creates an instance of class A and an instance of class `B`. These objects become eligible for garbage collection when the variable `b` is assigned the value `null`, since after this time it is impossible for any user-written code to access them. The output could be either

```plaintext
Finalize instance of A
Finalize instance of B
```

or
```plaintext
Finalize instance of B
Finalize instance of A
```

because the language imposes no constraints on the order in which objects are garbage collected.

In subtle cases, the distinction between “eligible for finalization” and “eligible for collection” can be important. For example,
```csharp
using System;

class A
{\
    A ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Finalize instance of A");
    }
    public void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("A.F");
        Test.RefA = this;
    }
}

class B
{
    public A Ref;\
    B ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Finalize instance of B");
        Ref.F ();
    }
}

class Test
{
    public static A RefA;
    public static B RefB;
    static void Main()
    {
        RefB = new B ();
        RefA = new A ();
        RefB.Ref = RefA;
        RefB = null;
        RefA = null;

        // A and B now eligible for finalization
        GC.Collect ();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers ();
        // B now eligible for collection, but A is not
        if (RefA != null)
            Console.WriteLine ("RefA is not null");
    }
}
```
In the above program, if the garbage collector chooses to run the finalizer of `A` before the finalizer of `B`, then the output of this program might be:
```plaintext
Finalize instance of A
Finalize instance of B
A.F
RefA is not null
```

Note that although the instance of `A` was not in use and `A`'s finalizer was run, it is still possible for methods of `A` (in this case, `F`) to be called from another finalizer. Also, note that running of a finalizer might cause an object to become usable from the mainline program again. In this case, the running of `B`'s finalizer caused an instance of `A` that was previously not in use, to become accessible from the live reference `Test.RefA`. After the call to WaitForPendingFinalizers, the instance of B is eligible for collection, but the instance of `A` is not, because of the reference `Test.RefA`. *end example*]

## Execution order

Execution of a C# program proceeds such that the side effects of each executing thread are preserved at critical execution points. A ***side effect*** is defined as a read or write of a volatile field, a write to a non-volatile variable, a write to an external resource, and the throwing of an exception. The critical execution points at which the order of these side effects shall be preserved are references to volatile fields (§15.5.4), lock statements (§13.13), and thread creation and termination. The execution environment is free to change the order of execution of a C# program, subject to the following constraints:

- Data dependence is preserved within a thread of execution. That is, the value of each variable is computed as if all statements in the thread were executed in original program order.
- Initialization ordering rules are preserved (§15.5.5, §15.5.6).
- The ordering of side effects is preserved with respect to volatile reads and writes (§15.5.4). Additionally, the execution environment need not evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that that expression’s value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced (including any caused by calling a method or accessing a volatile field). When program execution is interrupted by an asynchronous event (such as an exception thrown by another thread), it is not guaranteed that the observable side effects are visible in the original program order.

# Types

## General

The types of the C# language are divided into two main categories: ***reference types*** and ***value types***. Both value types and reference types may be ***generic types***, which take one or more ***type parameters***. Type parameters can designate both value types and reference types.

```antlr
type:
    reference-type
    value-type
    type-parameter

A third category of types, pointers, is available only in unsafe code (§23.3).

Value types differ from reference types in that variables of the value types directly contain their data, whereas variables of the reference types store ***references*** to their data, the latter being known as ***objects***. With reference types, it is possible for two variables to reference the same object, and thus possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it is not possible for operations on one to affect the other. 

> [!NOTE]
> When a variable is a ref or out parameter, it does not have its own storage but references the storage of another variable. In this case, the ref or out variable is effectively an alias for another variable and not a distinct variable. 

C#’s type system is unified such that *a value of any type can be treated as an object*. Every type in C# directly or indirectly derives from the object class type, and object is the ultimate base class of all types. Values of reference types are treated as objects simply by viewing the values as type object. Values of value types are treated as objects by performing boxing and unboxing operations (§9.3.12).

## Reference types

### General

A reference type is a class type, an interface type, an array type, a delegate type, or the dynamic type.

reference-type:
    class-type
    interface-type
    array-type
    delegate-type
    dynamic

class-type:
    type-name
    object
    string

interface-type:
    type-name

array-type:
    non-array-type rank-specifiers

non-array-type:
    value-type
    class-type
    interface-type
    delegate-type
    dynamic
    type-parameter

rank-specifiers:
    rank-specifier
    rank-specifiers rank-specifier

rank-specifier:
    [ dim-separatorsopt ]

dim-separators:
    ,
    dim-separators ,

delegate-type:
    type-name
```

A reference type value is a reference to an ***instance*** of the type, the latter known as an ***object***. The special value `null` is compatible with all reference types and indicates the absence of an instance.

### Class types

A class type defines a data structure that contains data members (constants and fields), function members (methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors), and nested types. Class types support inheritance, a mechanism whereby derived classes can extend and specialize base classes. Instances of class types are created using *object-creation-expression*s (§12.7.11.2).

Class types are described in §15.

Certain predefined class types have special meaning in the C# language, as described in the table below.

|  Class type        | Description                                              |
|  ------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------|
|  `System.Object`   |   The ultimate base class of all other types. See §9.2.3.|
|  `System.String`   |   The string type of the C# language. See §9.2.5.       |
|  `System.ValueType`|   The base class of all value types. See 9.3.2.         |
|  `System.Enum`     |   The base class of all enum types. See §19.5.          |
|  `System.Array`    |   The base class of all array types. See §17.2.2.       |
|  `System.Delegate` |   The base class of all delegate types. See §20.1.      |
|  `System.Exception`|   The base class of all exception types. See §21.3.     |

### The object type

The object class type is the ultimate base class of all other types. Every type in C# directly or indirectly derives from the object class type.

The keyword object is simply an alias for the predefined class `System.Object`.

### The dynamic type

The dynamic type, like object, can reference any object. When operations are applied to expressions of type dynamic, their resolution is deferred until the program is run. Thus, if the operation cannot legitimately be applied to the referenced object, no error is given during compilation. Instead, an exception will be thrown when resolution of the operation fails at run-time.

The dynamic type is further described in §9.7, and dynamic binding in §12.3.1.

### The string type

The string type is a sealed class type that inherits directly from object. Instances of the string class represent Unicode character strings.

Values of the string type can be written as string literals (§7.4.5.6).

The keyword string is simply an alias for the predefined class `System.String`.

### Interface types

An interface defines a contract. A class or struct that implements an interface shall adhere to its contract. An interface may inherit from multiple base interfaces, and a class or struct may implement multiple interfaces.

Interface types are described in §18.

### Array types

An array is a data structure that contains zero or more variables, which are accessed through computed indices. The variables contained in an array, also called the elements of the array, are all of the same type, and this type is called the element type of the array.

Array types are described in §17.

### Delegate types

A delegate is a data structure that refers to one or more methods. For instance methods, it also refers to their corresponding object instances.

> [!NOTE]
> The closest equivalent of a delegate in C or C++ is a function pointer, but whereas a function pointer can only reference static functions, a delegate can reference both static and instance methods. In the latter case, the delegate stores not only a reference to the method’s entry point, but also a reference to the object instance on which to invoke the method. 

Delegate types are described in §20.

##  Value types

### General

A value type is either a struct type or an enumeration type. C# provides a set of predefined struct types called the ***simple types***. The simple types are identified through keywords.

```antlr
value-type:
    struct-type
    enum-type

struct-type:
    type-name
    simple-type
    nullable-value-type

simple-type:
    numeric-type
    bool

numeric-type:
    integral-type
    floating-point-type
    decimal

integral-type:
    sbyte
    byte
    short
    ushort
    int
    uint
    long
    ulong
    char

floating-point-type:
    float
    double

nullable-type:
    non-nullable-value-type ?

non-nullable-value-type:
    type

enum-type:
    type-name
```

Unlike a variable of a reference type, a variable of a value type can contain the value null only if the value type is a nullable value type (§9.3.11). For every non-nullable value type there is a corresponding nullable value type denoting the same set of values plus the value null.

Assignment to a variable of a value type creates a *copy* of the value being assigned. This differs from assignment to a variable of a reference type, which copies the reference but not the object identified by the reference.

### The System.ValueType type

All value types implicitly inherit from the class `System.ValueType`, which, in turn, inherits from class `object`. It is not possible for any type to derive from a value type, and value types are thus implicitly sealed (§15.2.2.3).

Note that `System.ValueType` is not itself a *value-type*. Rather, it is a *class-type* from which all *value-type*s are automatically derived.

### Default constructors

All value types implicitly declare a public parameterless instance constructor called the ***default constructor***. The default constructor returns a zero-initialized instance known as the ***default value*** for the value type:

- For all *simple-types*, the default value is the value produced by a bit pattern of all zeros:
  - For `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, and `ulong`, the default value is 0.
  - For `char`, the default value is `'\\x0000`'.
  - For `float`, the default value is `0.0f`.
  - For `double`, the default value is 0.0`d`.
  - For `decimal`, the default value is `0.0m`.
  - For `bool`, the default value is `false`.
- For an *enum-type* E`, the default value is 0, converted to the type `E`.
- For a *struct-type*, the default value is the value produced by setting all value type fields to their default value and all reference type fields to `null`.
- For a *nullable-value-type* the default value is an instance for which the `HasValue` property is `false`. The default value is also known as the ***null value*** of the nullable value type. Attempting to read the `Value` property of such a value causes an exception of type `System.InvalidOperationException` to be thrown (§9.3.11).

Like any other instance constructor, the default constructor of a value type is invoked using the new operator. 
> [!NOTE]
> For efficiency reasons, this requirement is not intended to actually have the implementation generate a constructor call. For value types, the default value expression (§12.7.15) produces the same result as using the default constructor. 

[*Example*: In the code below, variables `i`, `j` and `k` are all initialized to zero.
```csharp
class A
{
    void F ()
    {
        int i = 0;
        int j = new int ();
        int k = default (int);
    }
}
```
*end example*]

Because every value type implicitly has a public parameterless instance constructor, it is not possible for a struct type to contain an explicit declaration of a parameterless constructor. A struct type is however permitted to declare parameterized instance constructors (§16.4.9).

### Struct types

A struct type is a value type that can declare constants, fields, methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, static constructors, and nested types. The declaration of struct types is described in §16.

### Simple types

C# provides a set of predefined struct types called the simple types. The simple types are identified through keywords, but these keywords are simply aliases for predefined struct types in the System namespace, as described in the table below.

|  Key**word**  | **Aliased type**   |
|  -------------| ------------------ |
|  `sbyte`      |   `System.SByte` |
|  `byte`       |   `System.Byte` |
|  `short`      |   `System.Int16` |
|  `ushort`     |   `System.UInt16` |
|  `int`        |   `System.Int32` |
|  `uint`       |   `System.`UInt32` |
|  `long`       |   `System.Int64` |
|  `ulong`      |   `System.UInt64` |
|  `char`       |   `System.`Char` |
|  `float`      |   `System.Single` |
|  `double`     |   `System.`Double` |
|  `bool`       |   `System.Boolean` |
|  `decimal`    |   `System.Decimal` |

Because a simple type aliases a struct type, every simple type has members. [*Example*: `int` has the members declared in `System.Int32` and the members inherited from `System.Object`, and the following statements are permitted:
```csharp
int i = int.MaxValue; // System.Int32.MaxValue constant
string s = i.ToString(); // System.Int32.ToString() instance method
string t = 123.ToString(); // System.Int32.ToString() instance method
```
*end example*] 

> [!NOTE]
> The simple types differ from other struct types in that they permit certain additional operations:
> 
> - Most simple types permit values to be created by writing *literals* (§7.4.5). [*Example*: 123 is a literal of type int and 'a' is a literal of type char. *end example*] C# makes no provision for literals of struct types in general.
> - When the operands of an expression are all simple type constants, it is possible for the compiler to evaluate the expression at compile-time. Such an expression is known as a *constant-expression* (§12.20). Expressions involving operators defined by other struct types are not considered to be constant expressions.
> - Through const declarations, it is possible to declare constants of the simple types (§15.4). It is not possible to have constants of other struct types, but a similar effect is provided by static readonly fields.
> - Conversions involving simple types can participate in evaluation of conversion operators defined by other struct types, but a user-defined conversion operator can never participate in evaluation of another user-defined conversionoperator (§11.5.3).

### Integral types

C# supports nine integral types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, and `char`. The integral types have the following sizes and ranges of values:

- The `sbyte` type represents signed 8-bit integers with values from -128 to 127, inclusive.
- The `byte` type represents unsigned 8-bit integers with values from 0 to 255, inclusive.
- The `short` type represents signed 16-bit integers with values from -32768 to 32767, inclusive.
- The `ushort` type represents unsigned 16-bit integers with values from 0 to 65535, inclusive.
- The `int` type represents signed 32-bit integers with values from -2147483648 to 2147483647, inclusive.
- The `uint` type represents unsigned 32-bit integers with values from 0 to 4294967295, inclusive.
- The `long` type represents signed 64-bit integers with values from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807, inclusive.
- The `ulong` type represents unsigned 64-bit integers with values from 0 to 18446744073709551615, inclusive.
- The `char` type represents unsigned 16-bit integers with values from 0 to 65535, inclusive. The set of possible values for the `char` type corresponds to the Unicode character set. \
  > [!NOTE]
  > Although char has the same representation as `ushort`, not all operations permitted on one type are permitted on the other.

The *integral-type* unary and binary operators always operate with signed 32-bit precision, unsigned 32-bit precision, signed 64-bit precision, or unsigned 64-bit precision, as detailed in §12.4.7.

The `char` type is classified as an integral type, but it differs from the other integral types in two ways:

- There are no predefined implicit conversions from other types to the `char` type. In particular, even though the `byte` and `ushort` types have ranges of values that are fully representable using the `char` type, implicit conversions from `sbyte`, `byte`, or `ushort` to `char` do not exist.
- Constants of the char type shall be written as *character-literal*s or as *integer-literal*s in combination with a cast to type `char`. [*Example*: `(char)10` is the same as '`\\x000A`'. *end example*]

The checked and unchecked operators and statements are used to control overflow checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions (§12.7.14). In a checked context, an overflow produces a compile-time error or causes a System.OverflowException to be thrown. In an unchecked context, overflows are ignored and any high-order bits that do not fit in the destination type are discarded.

### Floating-point types

C# supports two floating-point types: `float` and `double`. The `float` and `double` types are represented using the 32-bit single-precision and 64-bit double-precision IEC 60559 formats, which provide the following sets of values:

- Positive zero and negative zero. In most situations, positive zero and negative zero behave identically as the simple value zero, but certain operations distinguish between the two (§12.9.3).
- Positive infinity and negative infinity. Infinities are produced by such operations as dividing a non-zero number by zero. [*Example*: 1.0 / 0.0 yields positive infinity, and –1.0 / 0.0 yields negative infinity. *end example*]
- The ***Not-a-Number*** value, often abbreviated NaN. NaNs are produced by invalid floating-point operations, such as dividing zero by zero.
- The finite set of non-zero values of the form *s* × *m* × 2*^e^*, where *s* is 1 or −1, and *m* and *e* are determined by the particular floating-point type: For float, 0 < *m *< 2^24^ and −149 ≤ *e *≤ 104, and for double, 0 < *m *< 2^53^ and −1075 ≤ *e *≤ 970. Denormalized floating-point numbers are considered valid non-zero values. C# neither requires nor forbids that a conforming implementation support denormalized floating-point numbers.

The float type can represent values ranging from approximately 1.5 × 10^−45^ to 3.4 × 10^38^ with a precision of 7 digits.

The double type can represent values ranging from approximately 5.0 × 10^−324^ to 1.7 × 10^308^ with a precision of 15–16 digits.

If either operand of a binary operator is a floating-point type then standard numeric promotions are applied, as detailed in §12.4.7, and the operation is performed with float or double precision.

The floating-point operators, including the assignment operators, never produce exceptions. Instead, in exceptional situations, floating-point operations produce zero, infinity, or NaN, as described below:

- The result of a floating-point operation is rounded to the nearest representable value in the destination format.
- If the magnitude of the result of a floating-point operation is too small for the destination format, the result of the operation becomes positive zero or negative zero.
- If the magnitude of the result of a floating-point operation is too large for the destination format, the result of the operation becomes positive infinity or negative infinity.
- If a floating-point operation is invalid, the result of the operation becomes NaN.
- If one or both operands of a floating-point operation is NaN, the result of the operation becomes NaN.

Floating-point operations may be performed with higher precision than the result type of the operation. [*Example*: Some hardware architectures support an “extended” or “long double” floating-point type with greater range and precision than the double type, and implicitly perform all floating-point operations using this higher precision type. Only at excessive cost in performance can such hardware architectures be made to perform floating-point operations with *less* precision, and rather than require an implementation to forfeit both performance and precision, C# allows a higher precision type to be used for all floating-point operations. Other than delivering more precise results, this rarely has any measurable effects. However, in expressions of the form x * y / z, where the multiplication produces a result that is outside the double range, but the subsequent division brings the temporary result back into the double range, the fact that the expression is evaluated in a higher range format can cause a finite result to be produced instead of an infinity. To force a value of a floating-point type to the exact precision of its type, an explicit cast can be used. *end example*]

### The decimal type

The `decimal` type is a 128-bit data type suitable for financial and monetary calculations. The `decimal` type can represent values including those in the range at least –7.9 × 10^−28^ to 7.9 × 10^28^, with at least 28-digit precision.

The finite set of values of type `decimal` are of the form (–1)^s ^× *c *× 10^-e^, where the sign *s* is 0 or 1, the coefficient *c* is given by 0 ≤ *c *< *Cmax*, and the scale *e* is such that *Emin* ≤ e ≤ *Emax*, where *Cmax* is at least 1 × 10^28^, *Emin* ≤ 0, and *Emax* ≥ 28. The decimal type does not necessarily support signed zeros, infinities, or NaN's.

A `decimal` is represented as an integer scaled by a power of ten. For decimals with an absolute value less than 1.0m, the value is exact to at least the 28^th ^decimal place. For decimals with an absolute value greater than or equal to 1.0m, the value is exact to at least 28 digits. Contrary to the `float` and `double` data types, decimal fractional numbers such as 0.1 can be represented exactly in the `decimal` representation. In the `float` and `double` representations, such numbers often have non-terminating binary expansions, making those representations more prone to round-off errors.

If either operand of a binary operator is of `decimal` type then standard numeric promotions are applied, as detailed in §12.4.7, and the operation is performed with double precision.

The result of an operation on values of type `decimal` is that which would result from calculating an exact result (preserving scale, as defined for each operator) and then rounding to fit the representation. Results are rounded to the nearest representable value, and, when a result is equally close to two representable values, to the value that has an even number in the least significant digit position (this is known as “banker’s rounding”). That is, results are exact to at least the 28^th ^decimal place. Note that rounding may produce a zero value from a non-zero value.

If a `decimal` arithmetic operation produces a result whose magnitude is too large for the `decimal` format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.

The `decimal` type has greater precision but may have a smaller range than the floating-point types. Thus, conversions from the floating-point types to decimal might produce overflow exceptions, and conversions from `decimal` to the floating-point types might cause loss of precision or overflow exceptions. For these reasons, no implicit conversions exist between the floating-point types and `decimal`, and without explicit casts, a compile-time error occurs when floating-point and `decimal` operands are directly mixed in the same expression.

### The bool type

The `bool` type represents Boolean logical quantities. The possible values of type `bool` are `true` and `false`.

No standard conversions exist between `bool` and other value types. In particular, the `bool` type is distinct and separate from the integral types, a `bool` value cannot be used in place of an integral value, and vice versa.

> [!NOTE]
> In the C and C++ languages, a zero integral or floating-point value, or a null pointer can be converted to the Boolean value `false`, and a non-zero integral or floating-point value, or a non-null pointer can be converted to the Boolean value `true`. In C#, such conversions are accomplished by explicitly comparing an integral or floating-point value to zero, or by explicitly comparing an object reference to null.

### Enumeration types

An enumeration type is a distinct type with named constants. Every enumeration type has an underlying type, which shall be `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long` or `ulong`. The set of values of the enumeration type is the same as the set of values of the underlying type. Values of the enumeration type are not restricted to the values of the named constants. Enumeration types are defined through enumeration declarations (§19.2).

### Nullable value types

A nullable value type can represent all values of its ***underlying type*** plus an additional null value. A nullable value type is written `T?`, where `T` is the underlying type. This syntax is shorthand for `System.Nullable<T>`, and the two forms can be used interchangeably.

Conversely, a ***non-nullable value type*** is any value type other than `System.Nullable<T>` and its shorthand `T?` (for any `T`), plus any type parameter that is constrained to be a non-nullable value type (that is, any type parameter with a value type constraint (§15.2.5)). The `System.Nullable<T>` type specifies the value type constraint for T, which means that the underlying type of a nullable value type can be any non-nullable value type. The underlying type of a nullable value type cannot be a nullable value type or a reference type. For example, `int??` and `string?` are invalid types.

An instance of a nullable value type `T?` has two public read-only properties:

- A `HasValue` property of type `bool`
- A `Value` property of type `T`

An instance for which `HasValue` is `true` is said to be non-null. A non-null instance contains a known value and `Value` returns that value.

An instance for which `HasValue` is `false` is said to be null. A null instance has an undefined value. Attempting to read the Value of a null instance causes a `System.InvalidOperationException` to be thrown. The process of accessing the `Value` property of a nullable instance is referred to as ***unwrapping***.

In addition to the default constructor, every nullable value type `T?` has a public constructor with a single parameter of type `T`. Given a value `x` of type `T`, a constructor invocation of the form

`new T?(x)`

creates a non-null instance of `T?` for which the `Value` property is `x`. The process of creating a non-null instance of a nullable value type for a given value is referred to as ***wrapping***.

Implicit conversions are available from the `null` literal to `T?` (§11.2.6) and from `T` to `T?` (§11.2.5).

The nullable type `T?` implements no interfaces (§18). In particular, this means it does not implement any interface that the underlying type `T` does.

### Boxing and unboxing

The concept of boxing and unboxing provide a bridge between *value-type*s and *reference-type*s by permitting any value of a *value-type* to be converted to and from type object. Boxing and unboxing enables a unified view of the type system wherein a value of any type can ultimately be treated as an object.

Boxing is described in more detail in §11.2.8 and unboxing is described in §11.3.6.

## Constructed types

### General

A generic type declaration, by itself, denotes an ***unbound generic type*** that is used as a “blueprint” to form many different types, by way of applying ***type arguments***. The type arguments are written within angle brackets (< and >) immediately following the name of the generic type. A type that includes at least one type argument is called a ***constructed type***. A constructed type can be used in most places in the language in which a type name can appear. An unbound generic type can only be used within a *typeof-expression* (§12.7.12).

Constructed types can also be used in expressions as simple names (§12.7.3) or when accessing a member (§12.7.5).

When a *namespace-or-type-name* is evaluated, only generic types with the correct number of type parameters are considered. Thus, it is possible to use the same identifier to identify different types, as long as the types have different numbers of type parameters. This is useful when mixing generic and non-generic classes in the same program. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace Widgets
{
    class Queue {…}
    class Queue<TElement> {…}
}

namespace MyApplication
{
    using Widgets;

    class X
    {
        Queue q1; // Non-generic Widgets.Queue
        Queue<int> q2; // Generic Widgets.Queue
    }
}
```

*end example*]

The detailed rules for name lookup in the *namespace-or-type-name* productions is described in §8.8. The resolution of ambiguities in these productions is described in §7.2.5. A *type-name* might identify a constructed type even though it doesn’t specify type parameters directly. This can occur where a type is nested within a generic class declaration, and the instance type of the containing declaration is implicitly used for name lookup (§15.3.9.7). [*Example*:

```csharp
class Outer<T>
{
    public class Inner {…}

    public Inner i; // Type of i is Outer<T>.Inner
}
```
*end example*]

A non-enum constructed type shall not be used as an *unmanaged-type* (§23.3).

### Type arguments

Each argument in a type argument list is simply a *type*.

```antlr
type-argument-list:
    < type-arguments >

type-arguments:
    type-argument
    type-arguments , type-argument

type-argument:
    type
```

A *type-argument* shall not be a pointer type (§23). Each type argument shall satisfy any constraints on the corresponding type parameter (§15.2.5).

### Open and closed types

All types can be classified as either ***open types*** or ***closed types***. An open type is a type that involves type parameters. More specifically:

- A type parameter defines an open type.
- An array type is an open type if and only if its element type is an open type.
- A constructed type is an open type if and only if one or more of its type arguments is an open type. A constructed nested type is an open type if and only if one or more of its type arguments or the type arguments of its containing type(s) is an open type.

A closed type is a type that is not an open type.

At run-time, all of the code within a generic type declaration is executed in the context of a closed constructed type that was created by applying type arguments to the generic declaration. Each type parameter within the generic type is bound to a particular run-time type. The run-time processing of all statements and expressions always occurs with closed types, and open types occur only during compile-time processing.

Each closed constructed type has its own set of static variables, which are not shared with any other closed constructed types. Since an open type does not exist at run-time, there are no static variables associated with an open type. Two closed constructed types are the same type if they are constructed from the same unbound generic type, and their corresponding type arguments are the same type.

### Bound and unbound types

The term ***unbound type*** refers to a non-generic type or an unbound generic type. The term ***bound type*** refers to a non-generic type or a constructed type.

An unbound type refers to the entity declared by a type declaration. An unbound generic type is not itself a type, and cannot be used as the type of a variable, argument or return value, or as a base type. The only construct in which an unbound generic type can be referenced is the typeof expression (§12.7.12).

### Satisfying constraints

Whenever a constructed type or generic method is referenced, the supplied type arguments are checked against the type parameter constraints declared on the generic type or method (§15.2.5). For each where clause, the type argument `A` that corresponds to the named type parameter is checked against each constraint as follows:

- If the constraint is a class type, an interface type, or a type parameter, let `C` represent that constraint with the supplied type arguments substituted for any type parameters that appear in the constraint. To satisfy the constraint, it shall be the case that type `A` is convertible to type C by one of the following:
  - An identity conversion (§11.2.2)
  - An implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7)
  - A boxing conversion (§11.2.8), provided that type A is a non-nullable value type.
  - An implicit reference, boxing or type parameter conversion from a type parameter `A` to `C`.
- If the constraint is the reference type constraint (class), the type A shall satisfy one of the following:
  - `A` is an interface type, class type, delegate type, array type or the dynamic type. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > `System.ValueType` and `System.Enum` are reference types that satisfy this constraint.
  - `A` is a type parameter that is known to be a reference type (§9.2).
- If the constraint is the value type constraint (struct), the type `A` shall satisfy one of the following:
  - `A` is a struct type or enum type, but not a nullable value type. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > `System.ValueType` and `System.Enum` are reference types that do not satisfy this constraint. *end note*]
  - `A` is a type parameter having the value type constraint (§15.2.5).
- If the constraint is the constructor constraint `new()`, the type `A` shall not be abstract and shall have a public parameterless constructor. This is satisfied if one of the following is true:
  - `A` is a value type, since all value types have a public default constructor (§9.3.3).
  - `A` is a type parameter having the constructor constraint (§15.2.5).
  - `A` is a type parameter having the value type constraint (§15.2.5).
  - `A` is a class that is not abstract and contains an explicitly declared public constructor with no parameters.
  - `A` is not abstract and has a default constructor (§15.11.5).

A compile-time error occurs if one or more of a type parameter’s constraints are not satisfied by the given type arguments.

Since type parameters are not inherited, constraints are never inherited either. [*Example*: In the following, `D` needs to specify the constraint on its type parameter `T` so that `T` satisfies the constraint imposed by the base class `B<T>`. In contrast, class `E` need not specify a constraint, because `List<T>` implements `IEnumerable` for any `T`.

```csharp
class B<T> where T: IEnumerable {…}

class D<T>: B<T> where T: IEnumerable {…}

class E<T>: B<List<T>> {…}
```

*end example*]

## Type parameters

A type parameter is an identifier designating a value type or reference type that the parameter is bound to at run-time.

```antlr
type-parameter:
    identifier
```

Since a type parameter can be instantiated with many different type arguments, type parameters have slightly different operations and restrictions than other types. 

> [!NOTE]
> These include:
> 
>  - A type parameter cannot be used directly to declare a base class (§15.2.4.2) or interface (§18.2.4).
>  - The rules for member lookup on type parameters depend on the constraints, if any, applied to the type parameter. They are detailed in §12.5.
>  - The available conversions for a type parameter depend on the constraints, if any, applied to the type parameter. They are detailed in §11.2.11 and §11.3.8.
>  - The literal null cannot be converted to a type given by a type parameter, except if the type parameter is known to be a reference type (§11.2.11). However, a default expression (§12.7.15) can be used instead. In addition, a value with a type given by a type parameter *can* be compared with null using == and != (§12.11.7) unless the type parameter has the value type constraint.
>  - A new expression (§12.7.11.2) can only be used with a type parameter if the type parameter is constrained by a *constructor-constraint* or the value type constraint (§15.2.5).
>  - A type parameter cannot be used anywhere within an attribute.
>  - A type parameter cannot be used in a member access (§12.7.5) or type name (§8.8) to identify a static member or a nested type.
>  - A type parameter cannot be used as an *unmanaged-type* (§23.3).


As a type, type parameters are purely a compile-time construct. At run-time, each type parameter is bound to a run-time type that was specified by supplying a type argument to the generic type declaration. Thus, the type of a variable declared with a type parameter will, at run-time, be a closed constructed type (§9.4.3). The run-time execution of all statements and expressions involving type parameters uses the type that was supplied as the type argument for that parameter.

## Expression tree types

***Expression trees*** permit lambda expressions to be represented as data structures instead of executable code. Expression trees are values of ***expression tree types*** of the form `System.Linq.Expressions.Expression<TDelegate>`, where `TDelegate` is any delegate type. For the remainder of this specification we will refer to these types using the shorthand `Expression<TDelegate>`.

If a conversion exists from a lambda expression to a delegate type D, a conversion also exists to the expression tree type `Expression<TDelegate>`. Whereas the conversion of a lambda expression to a delegate type generates a delegate that references executable code for the lambda expression, conversion to an expression tree type creates an expression tree representation of the lambda expression.

Expression trees are efficient in-memory data representations of lambda expressions and make the structure of the lambda expression transparent and explicit.

Just like a delegate type `D`, `Expression<TDelegate>` is said to have parameter and return types, which are the same as those of `D`.

[*Example*: The following program represents a lambda expression both as executable code and as an expression tree. Because a conversion exists to `Func<int,int>`, a conversion also exists to `Expression<Func<int,int>>`:

```csharp
Func<int,int> del = x => x + 1; // Code

Expression<Func<int,int>> exp = x => x + 1; // Data
```

Following these assignments, the delegate del references a method that returns `x + 1`, and the expression tree exp references a data structure that describes the expression `x => x + 1`. *end example*]

The exact definition of the generic type `Expression<TDelegate>` as well as the precise rules for constructing an expression tree when a lambda expression is converted to an expression tree type, are implementation dependent.

Two things are important to make explicit:

- Not all lambda expressions can be converted to expression trees. For instance, lambda expressions with statement bodies, and lambda expressions containing assignment expressions cannot be represented. In these cases, a conversion still exists, but it will fail at compile-time. These exceptions are detailed in §11.7.3.
- `Expression<TDelegate>` offers an instance method `Compile` which produces a delegate of `type TDelegate`:
  ```csharp
  Func<int,int> del2 = exp.Compile();
  ```
  Invoking this delegate causes the code represented by the expression tree to be executed. Thus, given the definitions above, `del` and `del2` are equivalent, and the following two statements will have the same effect:
  
  ```csharp
  int i1 = del(1);
  int i2 = del2(1);
  ```
After executing this code, `i1` and `i2` will both have the value 2.

## The dynamic type

The type `dynamic` has special meaning in C#. Its purpose is to allow dynamic binding, which is described in detail in §12.3.2.

`dynamic` is considered identical to `object` except in the following respects:

- Operations on expressions of type `dynamic` can be dynamically bound (§12.3.3).
- Type inference (§12.6.3) will prefer `dynamic` over `object` if both are candidates.
- dynamic cannot be used as
  - the type in an *object-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.2)
  - a *predefined-type* in a *member-access* (§12.7.5.1)
  - the operand of the `typeof` operator
  - an attribute argument
  - a constraint
  - an extension method type
  - any part of a type argument within *struct-interfaces* (§16.2.4) or *interface-type-list* (§15.2.4.1).

Because of this equivalence, the following holds:

- There is an implicit identity conversion between `object` and `dynamic`, and between constructed types that are the same when replacing `dynamic` with `object`
- Implicit and explicit conversions to and from `object` also apply to and from `dynamic`.
- Signatures that are the same when replacing `dynamic` with object are considered the same signature
- The type `dynamic` is indistinguishable from `object` at run-time.
- An expression of the type `dynamic` is referred to as a ***dynamic expression***.

# Variables

## General

Variables represent storage locations. Every variable has a type that determines what values can be stored in the variable. C# is a type-safe language, and the C# compiler guarantees that values stored in variables are always of the appropriate type. The value of a variable can be changed through assignment or through use of the `++` and `--` operators.

A variable shall be ***definitely assigned*** (§10.4) before its value can be obtained.

As described in the following subclauses, variables are either ***initially assigned*** or ***initially unassigned***. An initially assigned variable has a well-defined initial value and is always considered definitely assigned. An initially unassigned variable has no initial value. For an initially unassigned variable to be considered definitely assigned at a certain location, an assignment to the variable shall occur in every possible execution path leading to that location.

## Variable categories

### General

C# defines seven categories of variables: static variables, instance variables, array elements, value parameters, reference parameters, output parameters, and local variables. The subclauses that follow describe each of these categories.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    public static int x;
    int y;

    void F (int[] v, int a, ref int b, out int c)
    {
        int i = 1;
        c = a + b++;
    }
}
```

`x` is a static variable, `y` is an instance variable, `v[0]` is an array element, `a` is a value parameter, `b` is a reference parameter, `c` is an output parameter, and `i` is a local variable. *end example*]

### Static variables

A field declared with the static modifier is called a ***static variable***. A static variable comes into existence before execution of the static constructor (§15.12) for its containing type, and ceases to exist when the associated application domain ceases to exist.

The initial value of a static variable is the default value (§10.3) of the variable’s type.

For the purposes of definite assignment checking, a static variable is considered initially assigned.

### Instance variables

#### General

A field declared without the static modifier is called an ***instance variable***.

#### Instance variables in classes

An instance variable of a class comes into existence when a new instance of that class is created, and ceases to exist when there are no references to that instance and the instance’s finalizer (if any) has executed.

The initial value of an instance variable of a class is the default value (§10.3) of the variable’s type.

For the purpose of definite assignment checking, an instance variable of a class is considered initially assigned.

#### Instance variables in structs

An instance variable of a struct has exactly the same lifetime as the struct variable to which it belongs. In other words, when a variable of a struct type comes into existence or ceases to exist, so too do the instance variables of the struct.

The initial assignment state of an instance variable of a struct is the same as that of the containing struct variable. In other words, when a struct variable is considered initially assigned, so too are its instance variables, and when a struct variable is considered initially unassigned, its instance variables are likewise unassigned.

### Array elements

The elements of an array come into existence when an array instance is created, and cease to exist when there are no references to that array instance.

The initial value of each of the elements of an array is the default value (§10.3) of the type of the array elements.

For the purpose of definite assignment checking, an array element is considered initially assigned.

### Value parameters

A parameter declared without a `ref` or `out` modifier is a ***value parameter***.

A value parameter comes into existence upon invocation of the function member (method, instance constructor, accessor, or operator) or anonymous function to which the parameter belongs, and is initialized with the value of the argument given in the invocation. A value parameter normally ceases to exist when execution of the function body completes. However, if the value parameter is captured by an anonymous function (§12.16.6.2), its lifetime extends at least until the delegate or expression tree created from that anonymous function is eligible for garbage collection.

For the purpose of definite assignment checking, a value parameter is considered initially assigned.

### Reference parameters

A parameter declared with a `ref` modifier is a ***reference parameter***.

A reference parameter does not create a new storage location. Instead, a reference parameter represents the same storage location as the variable given as the argument in the function member or anonymous function invocation. Thus, the value of a reference parameter is always the same as the underlying variable.

The following definite assignment rules apply to reference parameters. 
> [!NOTE]
> The rules for output parameters are different, and are described in §10.2.7. 

- A variable shall be definitely assigned (§10.4) before it can be passed as a reference parameter in a function member or delegate invocation.
- Within a function member or anonymous function, a reference parameter is considered initially assigned.

For a struct type, within an instance method or instance accessor (§12.2.1) or instance constructor with a constructor initializer, the `this` keyword behaves exactly as a reference parameter of the struct type (§12.7.8).

### Output parameters

A parameter declared with an `out` modifier is an ***output parameter***.

An output parameter does not create a new storage location. Instead, an output parameter represents the same storage location as the variable given as the argument in the function member or delegate invocation. Thus, the value of an output parameter is always the same as the underlying variable.

The following definite assignment rules apply to output parameters. 

> [!NOTE]
> The rules for reference parameters are different, and are described in §10.2.6.

- A variable need not be definitely assigned before it can be passed as an output parameter in a function member or delegate invocation.
- Following the normal completion of a function member or delegate invocation, each variable that was passed as an output parameter is considered assigned in that execution path.
- Within a function member or anonymous function, an output parameter is considered initially unassigned.
- Every output parameter of a function member or anonymous function shall be definitely assigned (§10.4) before the function member or anonymous function returns normally.

Within an instance constructor of a struct type, the this keyword behaves exactly as an output or reference parameter of the struct type, depending on whether the constructor declaration includes a constructor initializer (§12.7.8).

### Local variables

A ***local variable*** is declared by a *local-variable-declaration*, *foreach-statement*, or *specific-catch-clause* of a *try-statement*. For a *foreach-statement*, the local variable is an iteration variable (§13.9.5). For a *specific-catch-clause*, the local variable is an exception variable (§13.11). A local variable declared by a *foreach-statement* or *specific-catch-clause* is considered initially assigned.

A *local-variable-declaration* can occur in a *block*, a *for-statement*, a *switch-block*, or a *using-statement*.

The lifetime of a local variable is the portion of program execution during which storage is guaranteed to be reserved for it. This lifetime extends from entry into the scope with which it is associated, at least until execution of that scope ends in some way. (Entering an enclosed *block*, calling a method, or yielding a value from an iterator block suspends, but does not end, execution of the current scope.) If the local variable is captured by an anonymous function (§12.16.6.2), its lifetime extends at least until the delegate or expression tree created from the anonymous function, along with any other objects that come to reference the captured variable, are eligible for garbage collection. If the parent scope is entered recursively or iteratively, a new instance of the local variable is created each time, and its *local-variable-initializer*, if any, is evaluated each time. 

> [!NOTE]
> A local variable is instantiated each time its scope is entered. This behavior is visible to user code containing anonymous methods.

> [!NOTE]
> The lifetime of an *iteration variable* (§13.9.5) declared by a *foreach-statement* is a single iteration of that statement. Each iteration creates a new variable.

> [!NOTE]
> The actual lifetime of a local variable is implementation-dependent. For example, a compiler might statically determine that a local variable in a block is only used for a small portion of that block. Using this analysis, the compiler could generate code that results in the variable’s storage having a shorter lifetime than its containing block.
> 
> The storage referred to by a local reference variable is reclaimed independently of the lifetime of that local reference variable (§8.9).

A local variable introduced by a *local-variable-declaration* is not automatically initialized and thus has no default value. Such a local variable is considered initially unassigned. 

> [!NOTE]
> A *local-variable-declaration* that includes a *local-variable-initializer* is still initially unassigned. Execution of the declaration behaves exactly like an assignment to the variable (§10.4.4.5). It is possible to use a variable without executing its *local-variable-initializer*; e.g., within the initializer expression itself or by using a *goto-statement* to bypass the initialization:
> 
>  ```csharp
>  goto L;
> 
>  int x = 1; // never executed
> 
>  L: x += 1; // error: x not definitely assigned
> ```

Within the scope of a local variable, it is a compile-time error to refer to that local variable in a textual position that precedes its *local-variable-declarator*.

## Default values

The following categories of variables are automatically initialized to their default values:

- Static variables.
- Instance variables of class instances.
- Array elements.

The default value of a variable depends on the type of the variable and is determined as follows:

- For a variable of a *value-type*, the default value is the same as the value computed by the *value-type*’s default constructor (§9.3.3).
- For a variable of a *reference-type*, the default value is `null`.

> [!NOTE]
> Initialization to default values is typically done by having the memory manager or garbage collector initialize memory to all-bits-zero before it is allocated for use. For this reason, it is convenient to use all-bits-zero to represent the null reference.

## Definite assignment

### General

At a given location in the executable code of a function member or an anonymous function, a variable is said to be ***definitely assigned*** if the compiler can prove, by a particular static flow analysis (§10.4.4), that the variable has been automatically initialized or has been the target of at least one assignment. 

> [!NOTE]
> Informally stated, the rules of definite assignment are:
> 
> - An initially assigned variable (§10.4.2) is always considered definitely assigned.
> - An initially unassigned variable (§10.4.3) is considered definitely assigned at a given location if all possible execution paths leading to that location contain at least one of the following:
>   - A simple assignment (§12.18.2) in which the variable is the left operand.
>   - An invocation expression (§12.7.6) or object creation expression (§12.7.11.2) that passes the variable as an output parameter.
>   - For a local variable, a local variable declaration for the variable (§13.6.2) that includes a variable initializer.
> 
> The formal specification underlying the above informal rules is described in §10.4.2, §10.4.3, and §10.4.4.

The definite assignment states of instance variables of a *struct-type* variable are tracked individually as well as collectively. In additional to the rules above, the following rules apply to *struct-type* variables and their instance variables:

- An instance variable is considered definitely assigned if its containing *struct-type* variable is considered definitely assigned.
- A *struct-type* variable is considered definitely assigned if each of its instance variables is considered definitely assigned.

Definite assignment is a requirement in the following contexts:

- A variable shall be definitely assigned at each location where its value is obtained. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > This ensures that undefined values never occur.
  The occurrence of a variable in an expression is considered to obtain the value of the variable, except when
  - the variable is the left operand of a simple assignment,
  - the variable is passed as an output parameter, or
  - the variable is a *struct-type* variable and occurs as the left operand of a member access.
- A variable shall be definitely assigned at each location where it is passed as a reference parameter. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > This ensures that the function member being invoked can consider the reference parameter initially assigned.
- All output parameters of a function member shall be definitely assigned at each location where the function member returns (through a return statement or through execution reaching the end of the function member body).
  > [!NOTE]
  > This ensures that function members do not return undefined values in output parameters, thus enabling the compiler to consider a function member invocation that takes a variable as an output parameter equivalent to an assignment to the variable.
- The this variable of a *struct-type* instance constructor shall be definitely assigned at each location where that instance constructor returns.

### Initially assigned variables

The following categories of variables are classified as initially assigned:

- Static variables.
- Instance variables of class instances.
- Instance variables of initially assigned struct variables.
- Array elements.
- Value parameters.
- Reference parameters.
- Variables declared in a catch clause or a foreach statement.

### Initially unassigned variables

The following categories of variables are classified as initially unassigned:

- Instance variables of initially unassigned struct variables.
- Output parameters, including the this variable of struct instance constructors without a constructor initializer.
- Local variables, except those declared in a `catch` clause or a `foreach` statement.

### Precise rules for determining definite assignment

#### General

In order to determine that each used variable is definitely assigned, the compiler shall use a process that is equivalent to the one described in this subclause.

The compiler processes the body of each function member that has one or more initially unassigned variables. For each initially unassigned variable *v*, the compiler determines a ***definite assignment state*** for *v* at each of the following points in the function member:

- At the beginning of each statement
- At the end point (§13.2) of each statement
- On each arc which transfers control to another statement or to the end point of a statement
- At the beginning of each expression
- At the end of each expression

The definite assignment state of *v* can be either:

- Definitely assigned. This indicates that on all possible control flows to this point, *v* has been assigned a value.
- Not definitely assigned. For the state of a variable at the end of an expression of type bool, the state of a variable that isn’t definitely assigned might (but doesn’t necessarily) fall into one of the following sub-states:
  - Definitely assigned after true expression. This state indicates that *v* is definitely assigned if the Boolean expression evaluated as `true`, but is not necessarily assigned if the Boolean expression evaluated as `false`.
  - Definitely assigned after false expression. This state indicates that *v* is definitely assigned if the Boolean expression evaluated as `false`, but is not necessarily assigned if the Boolean expression evaluated as `true`.

The following rules govern how the state of a variable *v* is determined at each location.

#### General rules for statements

- *v* is not definitely assigned at the beginning of a function member body.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of any other statement is determined by checking the definite assignment state of *v* on all control flow transfers that target the beginning of that statement. If (and only if) *v* is definitely assigned on all such control flow transfers, then *v* is definitely assigned at the beginning of the statement. The set of possible control flow transfers is determined in the same way as for checking statement reachability (§13.2).
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the end point of a block, checked, unchecked, if, while, do, for, foreach, lock, using, or switch statement is determined by checking the definite assignment state of *v* on all control flow transfers that target the end point of that statement. If *v* is definitely assigned on all such control flow transfers, then *v* is definitely assigned at the end point of the statement. Otherwise, *v* is not definitely assigned at the end point of the statement. The set of possible control flow transfers is determined in the same way as for checking statement reachability (§13.2).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Because there are no control paths to an unreachable statement, *v* is definitely assigned at the beginning of any unreachable statement.

#### Block statements, checked, and unchecked statements

The definite assignment state of *v* on the control transfer to the first statement of the statement list in the block (or to the end point of the block, if the statement list is empty) is the same as the definite assignment statement of *v* before the block, checked, or unchecked statement.

#### Expression statements

For an expression statement *stmt* that consists of the expression *expr*:

- *v* has the same definite assignment state at the beginning of *expr* as at the beginning of *stmt*.
- If *v* if definitely assigned at the end of *expr*, it is definitely assigned at the end point of *stmt*; otherwise, it is not definitely assigned at the end point of *stmt*.

#### Declaration statements

- If *stmt* is a declaration statement without initializers, then *v* has the same definite assignment state at the end point of *stmt* as at the beginning of *stmt*.
- If *stmt* is a declaration statement with initializers, then the definite assignment state for *v* is determined as if *stmt* were a statement list, with one assignment statement for each declaration with an initializer (in the order of declaration).

#### If statements

For an `if` statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
if ( *expr* ) *then-stmt* else *else-stmt*
```

- *v* has the same definite assignment state at the beginning of *expr* as at the beginning of *stmt*.
- If *v* is definitely assigned at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *then-stmt* and to either *else-stmt* or to the end-point of *stmt* if there is no else clause.
- If *v* has the state “definitely assigned after true expression” at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *then-stmt*, and not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to either *else-stmt* or to the end-point of *stmt* if there is no else clause.
- If *v* has the state “definitely assigned after false expression” at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *else-stmt*, and not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *then-stmt*. It is definitely assigned at the end-point of *stmt* if and only if it is definitely assigned at the end-point of *then-stmt*.
- Otherwise, *v* is considered not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to either the *then-stmt* or *else-stmt*, or to the end-point of *stmt* if there is no else clause.

#### Switch statements

In a `switch` statement *stmt* with a controlling expression *expr*:

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expr* is the same as the state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* on the control flow transfer to a reachable `switch` block statement list is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the end of *expr*.

#### While statements

For a while statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
while ( *expr* ) *while-body*
```

- *v* has the same definite assignment state at the beginning of *expr* as at the beginning of *stmt*.
- If *v* is definitely assigned at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *while-body* and to the end point of *stmt*.
- If *v* has the state “definitely assigned after true expression” at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *while-body*, but not definitely assigned at the end-point of *stmt*.
- If *v* has the state “definitely assigned after false expression” at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to the end point of *stmt*, but not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *while-body*.

#### Do statements

For a do statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
do *do-body* while ( *expr* ) ;
```

- *v* has the same definite assignment state on the control flow transfer from the beginning of *stmt* to *do-body* as at the beginning of *stmt*.
- *v* has the same definite assignment state at the beginning of *expr* as at the end point of *do-body*.
- If *v* is definitely assigned at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to the end point of *stmt*.
- If *v* has the state “definitely assigned after false expression” at the end of *expr*, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to the end point of *stmt*, but not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to *do-body*.

#### For statements

Definite assignment checking for a for statement of the form:

```csharp
for ( *for-initializer* ; *for-condition* ; *for-iterator* ) *embedded-statement*
```

is done as if the statement were written:

```csharp
{
for -initializer;
while (
    for -condition)
{
    embedded - statement;
    LLoop : for -iterator;
}
}
```

with continue statements that target the for statement being translated to goto statements targeting the label LLoop. If the *for-condition* is omitted from the for statement, then evaluation of definite assignment proceeds as if *for-condition* were replaced with true in the above expansion.

#### Break, continue, and goto statements

The definite assignment state of *v* on the control flow transfer caused by a break, continue, or goto statement is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of the statement.

#### Throw statements

For a statement *stmt* of the form

```csharp
throw *expr* ;
```

the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expr* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.

#### Return statements

For a statement *stmt* of the form

```csharp
return *expr* ;
```

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expr* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- If *v* is an output parameter, then it shall be definitely assigned either:
  - after *expr*
  - or at the end of the finally block of a try-finally or try-catch-finally that encloses the return statement.

For a statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
return ;
```

- If *v* is an output parameter, then it shall be definitely assigned either:
  - before *stmt*
  - or at the end of the finally block of a try-finally or try-catch-finally that encloses the return statement.

#### Try-catch statements

For a statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
try try-block
catch ( … ) catch-block-1
…
catch ( … ) catch-block-n
```

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *try-block* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *catch-block-i* (for any *i*) is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the end-point of *stmt* is definitely assigned if (and only if) *v* is definitely assigned at the end-point of *try-block* and every *catch-block-i* (for every *i* from 1 to *n*).

#### Try-finally statements

For a try statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
try *try-block* finally *finally-block*
```

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *try-block* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *finally-block* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the end-point of *stmt* is definitely assigned if (and only if) at least one of the following is true:
  - *v* is definitely assigned at the end-point of *try-block*
  - *v* is definitely assigned at the end-point of *finally-block*

If a control flow transfer (such as a `goto` statement) is made that begins within *try-block*, and ends outside of *try-block*, then *v* is also considered definitely assigned on that control flow transfer if *v* is definitely assigned at the end-point of *finally-block*. (This is not an only if—if *v* is definitely assigned for another reason on this control flow transfer, then it is still considered definitely assigned.)

#### Try-catch-finally statements

Definite assignment analysis for a try-catch-finally statement of the form:

```csharp
try try-block
catch ( … ) catch-block-1
…
catch ( … ) catch-block-n
finally finally-block
```

is done as if the statement were a `try-finally` statement enclosing a `try-catch` statement:

```csharp
try 
{
    try try-block
    catch ( … ) catch-block-1
    …
    catch ( … ) catch-block-n
}
finally finally-block
```

[*Example*: The following example demonstrates how the different blocks of a `try` statement (§13.11) affect definite assignment.

```csharp
class A
{
    static void F ()
    {
        int i, j;
        try
        {
            goto LABEL;
            // neither i nor j definitely assigned
            i = 1;
            // i definitely assigned
        }

        catch
        {
            // neither i nor j definitely assigned
            i = 3;
            // i definitely assigned
        }

        finally
        {
            // neither i nor j definitely assigned
            j = 5;
            // j definitely assigned
        }
        // i and j definitely assigned
        LABEL: ;
        // j definitely assigned

    }
}
```

*end example*]

#### Foreach statements

For a foreach statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
foreach ( type identifier in expr ) embedded-statement
```

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expr* is the same as the state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* on the control flow transfer to *embedded-statement* or to the end point of *stmt* is the same as the state of *v* at the end of *expr*.

#### Using statements

For a using statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
using ( resource-acquisition ) embedded-statement
```

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *resource-acquisition* is the same as the state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* on the control flow transfer to *embedded-statement* is the same as the state of *v* at the end of *resource-acquisition*.

#### Lock statements

For a lock statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
lock ( expr ) embedded-statement
```

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expr* is the same as the state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* on the control flow transfer to *embedded-statement* is the same as the state of *v* at the end of *expr*.

#### Yield statements

For a yield return statement *stmt* of the form:

```csharp
yield return expr ;
```

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expr* is the same as the state of *v* at the beginning of *stmt*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the end of *stmt* is the same as the state of *v* at the end of *expr*.

A `yield break` statement has no effect on the definite assignment state.

#### General rules for constant expressions

The following applies to any constant expression, and takes priority over any rules from the following sections that might apply:

For a constant expression with value `true`:

- If *v* is definitely assigned before the expression, then *v* is definitely assigned after the expression.
- Otherwise *v* is “definitely assigned after false expression” after the expression.

[*Example*:

```csharp
int x;
if (true) { }
else
{
    Console.WriteLine (x);
}
```

*end example*]

For a constant expression with value `false`:

- If *v* is definitely assigned before the expression, then *v* is definitely assigned after the expression.
- Otherwise *v* is “definitely assigned after true expression” after the expression.

[*Example*:

```csharp
int x;
if (false)
{
    Console.WriteLine (x);
}
```

*end example*]

For all other constant expressions, the definite assignment state of *v* after the expression is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* before the expression.

#### General rules for simple expressions

The following rule applies to these kinds of expressions: literals (§12.7.2), simple names (§12.7.3), member access expressions (§12.7.5), non-indexed base access expressions (§12.7.9), typeof expressions (§12.7.12), and default value expressions (§12.7.15).

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the end of such an expression is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of the expression.

#### General rules for expressions with embedded expressions

The following rules apply to these kinds of expressions: parenthesized expressions (§12.7.4), element access expressions (§12.7.7), base access expressions with indexing (§12.7.9), increment and decrement expressions (§12.7.10, §12.8.6), cast expressions (§12.8.7), unary +, -, ~, * expressions, binary +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>, <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, is, as, &, |, ^ expressions (§12.9, §12.10, §12.11, §12.12), compound assignment expressions (§12.18.3), checked and unchecked expressions (§12.7.14), array and delegate creation expressions (§12.7.11) , and await expressions (§12.8.8).

Each of these expressions has one or more subexpressions that are unconditionally evaluated in a fixed order. [*Example*: The binary `%` operator evaluates the left hand side of the operator, then the right hand side. An indexing operation evaluates the indexed expression, and then evaluates each of the index expressions, in order from left to right. *end example*] For an expression *expr*, which has subexpressions *expr1*, *expr2*, …, *exprn*, evaluated in that order:

- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expr1* is the same as the definite assignment state at the beginning of *expr*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the beginning of *expri* (*i* greater than one) is the same as the definite assignment state at the end of *expri-1*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* at the end of *expr* is the same as the definite assignment state at the end of *exprn*.

#### Invocation expressions and object creation expressions

If the method to be invoked is a partial method that has no implementing partial method declaration, or is a conditional method for which the call is omitted (§22.5.3.2), then the definite assignment state of *v* after the invocation is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* before the invocation. Otherwise the following rules apply:

For an invocation expression *expr* of the form:

```
primary-expression ( arg1, arg2, … , argn )
```

or an object creation expression *expr* of the form:

```
new type ( arg1, arg2, … , argn )
```

- For an invocation expression, the definite assignment state of *v* before *primary-expression* is the same as the state of *v* before *expr*.
- For an invocation expression, the definite assignment state of *v* before *arg1* is the same as the state of *v* after *primary-expression*.
- For an object creation expression, the definite assignment state of *v* before *arg1* is the same as the state of *v* before *expr*.
- For each argument *argi*, the definite assignment state of *v* after *argi* is determined by the normal expression rules, ignoring any ref or out modifiers.
- For each argument *argi* for any *i* greater than one, the definite assignment state of *v* before *argi* is the same as the state of *v* after *argi-1*.
- If the variable *v* is passed as an out argument (i.e., an argument of the form “out *v*”) in any of the arguments, then the state of *v* after *expr* is definitely assigned. Otherwise, the state of *v* after *expr* is the same as the state of *v* after *argn*.
- For array initializers (§12.7.11.5), object initializers (12.7.11.3), collection initializers (§12.7.11.4) and anonymous object initializers (§12.7.11.7), the definite assignment state is determined by the expansion that these constructs are defined in terms of.

#### Simple assignment expressions

For an expression *expr* of the form *w* = *expr-rhs*:

- The definite assignment state of *v* before *w* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* before *expr*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-rhs* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* after *w*.
- If *w* is the same variable as *v*, then the definite assignment state of *v* after *expr* is definitely assigned. Otherwise, the definite assignment state of *v* after *expr* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* after *expr-rhs*.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    static void F (int[] arr)
    {
        int x;

        arr[x = 1] = x; // ok
    }
}
```

the variable `x` is considered definitely assigned after `arr[x = 1]` is evaluated as the left hand side of the second simple assignment. *end example*]

#### && expressions

For an expression *expr* of the form *expr-first* && *expr-second*:

- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-first* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* before *expr*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-second* is definitely assigned if and only if the state of *v* after *expr-first* is either definitely assigned or “definitely assigned after true expression”. Otherwise, it is not definitely assigned.
- The definite assignment state of *v* after *expr* is determined by:
  - If the state of *v* after *expr-first* is definitely assigned, then the state of *v* after *expr* is definitely assigned.
  - Otherwise, if the state of *v* after *expr-second* is definitely assigned, and the state of *v* after *expr-first* is “definitely assigned after false expression”, then the state of *v* after *expr* is definitely assigned.
- Otherwise, if the state of *v* after *expr-second* is definitely assigned or “definitely assigned after true expression”, then the state of *v* after *expr* is “definitely assigned after true expression”.
- Otherwise, if the state of *v* after *expr-first* is “definitely assigned after false expression”, and the state of *v* after *expr-second* is “definitely assigned after false expression”, then the state of *v* after *expr* is “definitely assigned after false expression”.
- Otherwise, the state of *v* after *expr* is not definitely assigned.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    static void F (int x, int y)
    {
        int i;
        if (x >= 0 && (i = y) >= 0)
        {
            // i definitely assigned
        }
        else
        {
            // i not definitely assigned
        }
        // i not definitely assigned
    }
}
```
the variable `i` is considered definitely assigned in one of the embedded statements of an `if` statement but not in the other. In the `if` statement in method `F`, the variable `i` is definitely assigned in the first embedded statement because execution of the expression `(i = y)` always precedes execution of this embedded statement. In contrast, the variable `i` is not definitely assigned in the second embedded statement, since `x >= 0` might have tested false, resulting in the variable `i`’s being unassigned. *end example*]

#### || expressions

For an expression *expr* of the form *expr-first* || *expr-second*:

- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-first* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* before *expr*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-second* is definitely assigned if and only if the state of *v* after *expr-first* is either definitely assigned or “definitely assigned after true expression”. Otherwise, it is not definitely assigned.
- The definite assignment statement of *v* after *expr* is determined by:
  - If the state of *v* after *expr-first* is definitely assigned, then the state of *v* after *expr* is definitely assigned.
  - Otherwise, if the state of *v* after *expr-second* is definitely assigned, and the state of *v* after *expr-first* is “definitely assigned after true expression”, then the state of *v* after *expr* is definitely assigned.
- Otherwise, if the state of *v* after *expr-second* is definitely assigned or “definitely assigned after false expression”, then the state of *v* after *expr* is “definitely assigned after false expression”.
- Otherwise, if the state of *v* after *expr-first* is “definitely assigned after true expression”, and the state of *v* after *expr-second* is “definitely assigned after true expression”, then the state of *v* after *expr* is “definitely assigned after true expression”.
- Otherwise, the state of *v* after *expr* is not definitely assigned.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    static void G (int x, int y)
    {
        int i;
        if (x >= 0 || (i = y) >= 0)
        {
            // i not definitely assigned
        }
        else
        {
            // i definitely assigned
        }
        // i not definitely assigned
    }
}
```

the variable `i` is considered definitely assigned in one of the embedded statements of an `if` statement but not in the other. In the `if` statement in method `G`, the variable `i` is definitely assigned in the second embedded statement because execution of the expression `(i = y)` always precedes execution of this embedded statement. In contrast, the variable `i` is not definitely assigned in the first embedded statement, since `x >= 0` might have tested true, resulting in the variable `i`'s being unassigned. *end example*]

#### ! expressions

For an expression *expr* of the form ! *expr-operand*:

- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-operand* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* before *expr*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* after *expr* is determined by:
  - If the state of v after *expr-operand* is definitely assigned, then the state of v after *expr* is definitely assigned.
  - Otherwise, if the state of v after *expr-operand* is “definitely assigned after false expression”, then the state of v after *expr* is “definitely assigned after true expression”.
- Otherwise, if the state of v after *expr-operand* is “definitely assigned after true expression”, then the state of v after *expr* is “definitely assigned after false expression”.
- Otherwise, the state of v after *expr* is not definitely assigned.

#### ?? expressions

For an expression *expr* of the form *expr-first* ?? *expr-second*:

- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-first* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* before *expr*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-second* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* after *expr-first*.
- The definite assignment statement of *v* after *expr* is determined by:
  - If *expr-first* is a constant expression (§12.20) with value null, then the state of *v* after *expr* is the same as the state of *v* after *expr-second*.
  - Otherwise, the state of *v* after *expr* is the same as the definite assignment state of *v* after *expr-first*.

#### ?: expressions

For an expression *expr* of the form *expr-cond* ? *expr-true* : *expr-false*:

- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-cond* is the same as the state of *v* before *expr*.
- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-true* is definitely assigned if the state of *v* after *expr-cond* is definitely assigned or “definitely assigned after true expression”.
- The definite assignment state of *v* before *expr-false* is definitely assigned if the state of *v* after *expr-cond* is definitely assigned or “definitely assigned after false expression”.
- The definite assignment state of *v* after *expr* is determined by:
  - If *expr-cond* is a constant expression (§12.20) with value true then the state of *v* after *expr* is the same as the state of *v* after *expr-true*.
  - Otherwise, if *expr-cond* is a constant expression (§12.20) with value false then the state of *v* after *expr* is the same as the state of *v* after *expr-false*.
- Otherwise, if the state of *v* after *expr-true* is definitely assigned and the state of *v* after *expr-false* is definitely assigned, then the state of *v* after *expr* is definitely assigned.
- Otherwise, the state of *v* after *expr* is not definitely assigned.

#### Anonymous functions

For a *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression* *expr* with a body (either *block* or *expression*) *body*:

- The definite assignment state of a parameter is the same as for a parameter of a named method (§10.2.6, §10.2.7).
- The definite assignment state of an outer variable *v* before *body* is the same as the state of *v* before *expr*. That is, definite assignment state of outer variables is inherited from the context of the anonymous function.
- The definite assignment state of an outer variable *v* after *expr* is the same as the state of *v* before *expr*.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
delegate bool Filter (int i);

void F ()
{
    int max;

    // Error, max is not definitely assigned
    Filter f = (int n) => n < max;

    max = 5;
    DoWork (f);
}
```
generates a compile-time error since max is not definitely assigned where the anonymous function is declared. *end example*] [*Example*: The example

```csharp
delegate void D ();

void F ()
{
    int n;
    D d = () => { n = 1; };

    d ();

    // Error, n is not definitely assigned
    Console.WriteLine (n);
}
```

also generates a compile-time error since the assignment to `n` in the anonymous function has no affect on the definite assignment state of `n` outside the anonymous function. *end example*]

## Variable references

A *variable-reference* is an *expression* that is classified as a variable. A *variable-reference* denotes a storage location that can be accessed both to fetch the current value and to store a new value.

```antlr
variable-reference:
    expression
```

> [!NOTE]
> In C and C++, a *variable-reference* is known as an *lvalue*.

## Atomicity of variable references

Reads and writes of the following data types shall be atomic: `bool`, `char`, `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `uint`, `int`, `float`, and reference types. In addition, reads and writes of enum types with an underlying type in the previous list shall also be atomic. Reads and writes of other types, including `long`, `ulong`, `double`, and `decimal`, as well as user-defined types, need not be atomic. Aside from the library functions designed for that purpose, there is no guarantee of atomic read-modify-write, such as in the case of increment or decrement.

# Conversions

## General

A ***conversion*** causes an expression to be converted to, or treated as being of, a particular type; in the former case a conversion may involve a change in representation. Conversions can be ***implicit*** or ***explicit***, and this determines whether an explicit cast is required. [*Example*: For instance, the conversion from type int to type long is implicit, so expressions of type int can implicitly be treated as type long. The opposite conversion, from type long to type int, is explicit and so an explicit cast is required.

```csharp
int a = 123;
long b = a; // implicit conversion from int to long
int c = (int) b; // explicit conversion from long to int
```

*end example*] Some conversions are defined by the language. Programs may also define their own conversions (§11.5).

Some conversions in the language are defined from expressions to types, others from types to types. A conversion from a type applies to all expressions that have that type. [*Example*:

```csharp
enum Color { Red, Blue, Green }

Color c0 = 0; // The expression 0 converts implicitly to enum types
Color c1 = (Color)1; // other int expressions need explicit conversion

String x = null; // Conversion from null expression (no type) to String

Func<int, int> square = x => x * x; // Conversion from lambda expression to delegate type
```

*end example*]

## Implicit conversions

### General

The following conversions are classified as implicit conversions:

- Identity conversions
- Implicit numeric conversions
- Implicit enumeration conversions
- Implicit reference conversions
- Boxing conversions
- Implicit dynamic conversions
- Implicit type parameter conversions
- Implicit constant expression conversions
- User-defined implicit conversions
- Anonymous function conversions
- Method group conversions
- Null literal conversions
- Implicit nullable conversions
- Lifted user-defined implicit conversions

Implicit conversions can occur in a variety of situations, including function member invocations (§12.6.6), cast expressions (§12.8.7), and assignments (§12.18).

The pre-defined implicit conversions always succeed and never cause exceptions to be thrown. 

> [!NOTE]
> Properly designed user-defined implicit conversions should exhibit these characteristics as well.

For the purposes of conversion, the types `object` and `dynamic` are considered equivalent.

However, `dynamic` conversions (§11.2.9 and §11.3.7) apply only to expressions of type `dynamic` (§9.2.4).

### Identity conversion

An identity conversion converts from any type to the same type. One reason this conversion exists is so that a type T or an expression of type T can be said to be convertible to T itself.

Because object and dynamic are considered equivalent there is an identity conversion between object and dynamic, and between constructed types that are the same when replacing all occurrences of dynamic with object.

In most cases, an identity conversion has no effect at runtime. However, since floating point operations may be performed at higher precision than prescribed by their type (§9.3.7), assignment of their results may result in a loss of precision, and explicit casts are guaranteed to reduce precision to what is prescribed by the type.

### Implicit numeric conversions

The implicit numeric conversions are:

- From `sbyte` to `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `byte` to `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `short` to `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `ushort` to `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `int` to `long`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `uint` to `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `long` to `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `ulong` to `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `char` to `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From `float` to `double`.

Conversions from `int`, `uint`, `long` or `ulong` to `float` and from `long` or `ulong` to `double` may cause a loss of precision, but will never cause a loss of magnitude. The other implicit numeric conversions never lose any information.

There are no predefined implicit conversions to the char type, so values of the other integral types do not automatically convert to the `char` type.

### Implicit enumeration conversions

An implicit enumeration conversion permits the *decimal-integer-literal *0 (or 0L, etc.) to be converted to any *enum-type* and to any *nullable-value-type* whose underlying type is an *enum-type*. In the latter case the conversion is evaluated by converting to the underlying *enum-type* and wrapping the result (§9.3.11).

### Implicit nullable conversions

The implicit nullable conversions are those nullable conversions (§11.6.1) derived from implicit predefined conversions.

### Null literal conversions

An implicit conversion exists from the `null` literal to any reference type or nullable value type. This conversion produces a null reference if the target type is a reference type, or the `null` value (§9.3.11) of the given nullable value type.

### Implicit reference conversions

The implicit reference conversions are:

- From any *reference-type* to object and dynamic.
- From any *class-type *`S` to any *class-type *`T`, provided `S` is derived from `T`.
- From any *class-type *`S` to any *interface-type *`T`, provided `S` implements `T`.
- From any *interface-type *`S` to any *interface-type *`T`, provided `S` is derived from `T`.
- From an *array-type *`S` with an element type `SE` to an *array-type *`T` with an element type `TE`, provided all of the following are true:
  - `S` and `T` differ only in element type. In other words, `S` and `T` have the same number of dimensions.
  - An implicit reference conversion exists from `SE` to `TE`.
- From a single-dimensional array type `S[]` to `System.Collections.Generic.IList<T>`, `System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<T>`, and their base interfaces, provided that there is an implicit identity or reference conversion from `S` to `T`.
- From any *array-type* to `System.Array` and the interfaces it implements.
- From any *delegate-type* to `System.Delegate` and the interfaces it implements.
- From the `null` literal (§7.4.5.7) to any reference-type.
- From any *reference-type* to a *reference-type* `T` if it has an implicit identity or reference conversion to a *reference-type* `T0` and `T0` has an identity conversion to `T`.
- From any *reference-type* to an interface or delegate type `T` if it has an implicit identity or reference conversion to an interface or delegate type `T0` and `T0` is variance-convertible (§18.2.3.3) to `T`.
- Implicit conversions involving type parameters that are known to be reference types. See §11.2.11 for more details on implicit conversions involving type parameters.

The implicit reference conversions are those conversions between *reference-type*s that can be proven to always succeed, and therefore require no checks at run-time.

Reference conversions, implicit or explicit, never change the referential identity of the object being converted. 
> [!NOTE]
> In other words, while a reference conversion can change the type of the reference, it never changes the type or value of the object being referred to.

### Boxing conversions

A boxing conversion permits a *value-type* to be implicitly converted to a *reference-type*. The following boxing conversions exist:

- From any *value-type* to the type `object`.
- From any *value-type* to the type `System.ValueType`.
- From any *enum-type* to the type `System.Enum`.
- From any *non-nullable-value-type* to any *interface-type* implemented by the *non-nullable-value-type*.
- From any *non-nullable-value-type* to any *interface-type* `I` such that there is a boxing conversion from the *non-nullable-value-type* to another *interface-type* `I0`, and `I0` has an identity conversion to I.
- From any *non-nullable-value-type* to any *interface-type* `I` such that there is a boxing conversion from the *non-nullable-value-type* to another *interface-type* `I0`, and `I0` is variance-convertible (§18.2.3.3) to `I`.
- From any *nullable-value-type* to any *reference-type* where there is a boxing conversion from the underlying type of the *nullable-value-type* to the *reference-type.*
- From a type parameter that is not known to be a reference type to any type such that the conversion is permitted by §11.2.11.

Boxing a value of a *non-nullable-value-type* consists of allocating an object instance and copying the value into that instance.

Boxing a value of a *nullable-value-type* produces a null reference if it is the `null` value (`HasValue` is `false`), or the result of unwrapping and boxing the underlying value otherwise.

> [!NOTE]
> The process of boxing may be imagined in terms of the existence of a boxing class for every value type. For example, consider a struct `S` implementing an interface `I`, with a boxing class called `S_Boxing`.
> 
> ```csharp
> interface I
> {
>     void M ();
> }
> 
> struct S : I
> {
>     public void M () {…}
> }
> 
> sealed class S_Boxing : I
> {
>     S value;
>     public S _Boxing (S value)
>     {
>         this.value = value;
>     }
>     public void M ()
>     {
>         value.M ();
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> Boxing a value `v` of type `S` now consists of executing the expression new `S_Boxing(v)` and returning the resulting instance as a value of the target type of the conversion. Thus, the statements
> 
> ```csharp
> S s = new S();
> object box = s;
> ```
> 
> can be thought of as similar to:
> 
> ```csharp
> S s = new S();
> object box = new S_Boxing(s);
> ```
> 
> The imagined boxing type described above does not actually exist. Instead, a boxed value of type `S` has the runtime type `S`, and a runtime type check using the is operator with a value type as the right operand tests whether the left operand is a boxed version of the right operand. For example,
> 
> ```csharp
> int i = 123;
> object box = i;
> if (box is int)
> {
>     Console.Write ("Box contains an int");
> }
> ```
> 
> will output the string “Box contains an int” on the console.
> 
> A boxing conversion implies making a copy of the value being boxed. This is different from a conversion of a *reference-type* to type object, in which the value continues to reference the same instance and simply is regarded as the less derived type object. For example, given the declaration
> 
> ```csharp
> struct Point
> {
>     public int x, y;
> 
>     public Point (int x, int y)
>     {
>         this.x = x;
>         this.y = y;
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> the following statements
>  ```csharp
>  Point p = new Point (10, 10);
>  object box = p;
>  p.x = 20;
>  Console.Write (((Point) box).x);
>  ```
> will output the value 10 on the console because the implicit boxing operation that occurs in the assignment of p to box causes the value of p to be copied. Had Point been declared a class instead, the value 20 would be output because p and box would reference the same instance.
> 
> The analogy of a boxing class should not be used as more than a helpful tool for picturing how boxing works conceptually. There are numerous subtle differences between the behavior described by this specification and the behavior that would result from boxing being implemented in precisely this manner.

### Implicit dynamic conversions

An implicit dynamic conversion exists from an expression of type dynamic to any type `T`. The conversion is dynamically bound (§12.3.3), which means that an implicit conversion will be sought at run-time from the run-time type of the expression to `T`. If no conversion is found, a run-time exception is thrown.

This implicit conversion seemingly violates the advice in the beginning of §11.2 that an implicit conversion should never cause an exception. However, it is not the conversion itself, but the *finding* of the conversion that causes the exception. The risk of run-time exceptions is inherent in the use of dynamic binding. If dynamic binding of the conversion is not desired, the expression can be first converted to object, and then to the desired type.

[*Example:* The following illustrates implicit dynamic conversions:
```csharp
object o = “object”
dynamic d = “dynamic”;

string s1 = o; // Fails at compile-time – no conversion exists
string s2 = d; // Compiles and succeeds at run-time
int i = d; // Compiles but fails at run-time – no conversion exists
```

The assignments to `s2` and `i` both employ implicit dynamic conversions, where the binding of the operations is suspended until run-time. At run-time, implicit conversions are sought from the run-time type of `d` – `string` – to the target type. A conversion is found to `string` but not to `int`. *end example*]

### Implicit constant expression conversions

An implicit constant expression conversion permits the following conversions:

- A *constant-expression* (§12.20) of type `int` can be converted to type `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `uint`, or `ulong`, provided the value of the *constant-expression* is within the range of the destination type.
- A *constant-expression* of type `long` can be converted to type `ulong`, provided the value of the *constant-expression* is not negative.

### Implicit conversions involving type parameters

For a *type-parameter* `T` that is known to be a reference type (§15.2.5), the following implicit reference conversions (11.2.7) exist:

- From `T` to its effective base class `C`, from `T` to any base class of `C`, and from `T` to any interface implemented by `C`.
- From `T` to an *interface-type* `I` in `T`’s effective interface set and from `T` to any base interface of `I`.
- From `T` to a type parameter `U` provided that `T` depends on `U` (§15.2.5). 
  > [!NOTE]
  > Since `T` is known to be a reference type, within the scope of `T`, the run-time type of `U` will always be a reference type, even if `U` is not known to be a reference type at compile-time.
- From the `null` literal (§7.4.5.7) to `T`.

For a *type-parameter* `T` that is *not* known to be a reference type (§15.2.5), the following conversions involving `T` are considered to be boxing conversions (11.2.8) at compile-time. At run-time, if `T` is a value type, the conversion is executed as a boxing conversion. At run-time, if `T` is a reference type, the conversion is executed as an implicit reference conversion or identity conversion.

- From `T` to its effective base class `C`, from `T` to any base class of `C`, and from `T` to any interface implemented by `C`. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > `C` will be one of the types `System.Object`, `System.ValueType`, or `System.Enum` (otherwise `T` would be known to be a reference type).
- From `T` to an *interface-type* `I` in `T`’s effective interface set and from `T` to any base interface of `I`.

For a *type-parameter* `T` that is *not* known to be a reference type, there is an implicit conversion from `T` to a type parameter `U` provided `T` depends on `U`. At run-time, if `T` is a value type and `U` is a reference type, the conversion is executed as a boxing conversion. At run-time, if both `T` and `U` are value types, then `T` and `U `are necessarily the same type and no conversion is performed. At run-time, if `T` is a reference type, then `U` is necessarily also a reference type and the conversion is executed as an implicit reference conversion or identity conversion (§15.2.5).

The following further implicit conversions exist for a given type parameter `T`:

- From `T` to a reference type `S` if it has an implicit conversion to a reference type `S0` and `S0` has an identity conversion to `S`. At run-time, the conversion is executed the same way as the conversion to `S0`.
- From `T` to an interface type `I` if it has an implicit conversion to an interface type `I0`, and `I0` is variance-convertible to `I` (§18.2.3.3). At run-time, if `T` is a value type, the conversion is executed as a boxing conversion. Otherwise, the conversion is executed as an implicit reference conversion or identity conversion.

In all cases, the rules ensure that a conversion is executed as a boxing conversion if and only if at run-time the conversion is from a value type to a reference type.

### User-defined implicit conversions

A user-defined implicit conversion consists of an optional standard implicit conversion, followed by execution of a user-defined implicit conversion operator, followed by another optional standard implicit conversion. The exact rules for evaluating user-defined implicit conversions are described in §11.5.4.

### Anonymous function conversions and method group conversions

Anonymous functions and method groups do not have types in and of themselves, but they may be implicitly converted to delegate types. Additionally, some lambda expressions may be implicitly converted to expression tree types. Anonymous function conversions are described in more detail in §11.7 and method group conversions in §11.8.

## Explicit conversions

### General

The following conversions are classified as explicit conversions:

- All implicit conversions
- Explicit numeric conversions
- Explicit enumeration conversions
- Explicit nullable conversions.
- Explicit reference conversions
- Explicit interface conversions
- Unboxing conversions
- Explicit type parameter conversions
- Explicit dynamic conversions

Explicit conversions can occur in cast expressions (§12.8.7).

The set of explicit conversions includes all implicit conversions. 

> [!NOTE]
> This means that redundant cast expressions are allowed. 

The explicit conversions that are not implicit conversions are conversions that cannot be proven always to succeed, conversions that are known possibly to lose information, and conversions across domains of types sufficiently different to merit explicit notation.

### Explicit numeric conversions

The explicit numeric conversions are the conversions from a *numeric-type* to another *numeric-type* for which an implicit numeric conversion (§11.2.3) does not already exist:

- From `sbyte` to `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, or `char`.
- From `byte` to `sbyte` or `char`.
- From `short` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, or `char`.
- From `ushort` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, or `char`.
- From `int` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, or `char`.
- From `uint` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, or `char`.
- From `long` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `ulong`, or `char`.
- From `ulong` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `char`.
- From `char` to `sbyte`, `byte`, or `short`.
- From `float` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, or `decimal`.
- From `double` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, or `decimal`.
- From `decimal` to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, or `double`.

Because the explicit conversions include all implicit and explicit numeric conversions, it is always possible to convert from any *numeric-type* to any other *numeric-type* using a cast expression (§12.8.7).

The explicit numeric conversions possibly lose information or possibly cause exceptions to be thrown. An explicit numeric conversion is processed as follows:

- For a conversion from an integral type to another integral type, the processing depends on the overflow checking context (§12.7.14) in which the conversion takes place:
  - In a checked context, the conversion succeeds if the value of the source operand is within the range of the destination type, but throws a `System.OverflowException` if the value of the source operand is outside the range of the destination type.
  - In an unchecked context, the conversion always succeeds, and proceeds as follows.
    - If the source type is larger than the destination type, then the source value is truncated by discarding its “extra” most significant bits. The result is then treated as a value of the destination type.
    - If the source type is smaller than the destination type, then the source value is either sign-extended or zero-extended so that it is the same size as the destination type. Sign-extension is used if the source type is signed; zero-extension is used if the source type is unsigned. The result is then treated as a value of the destination type.
    - If the source type is the same size as the destination type, then the source value is treated as a value of the destination type
  - For a conversion from `decimal` to an integral type, the source value is rounded towards zero to the nearest integral value, and this integral value becomes the result of the conversion. If the resulting integral value is outside the range of the destination type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.
  - For a conversion from `float` or `double` to an integral type, the processing depends on the overflow-checking context (§12.7.14) in which the conversion takes place:
    - In a checked context, the conversion proceeds as follows:
    - If the value of the operand is `NaN` or `infinite`, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.
    - Otherwise, the source operand is rounded towards zero to the nearest integral value. If this integral value is within the range of the destination type then this value is the result of the conversion.
    - Otherwise, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.
  - In an unchecked context, the conversion always succeeds, and proceeds as follows.
    - If the value of the operand is `NaN` or `infinite`, the result of the conversion is an unspecified value of the destination type.
    - Otherwise, the source operand is rounded towards zero to the nearest integral value. If this integral value is within the range of the destination type then this value is the result of the conversion.
    - Otherwise, the result of the conversion is an unspecified value of the destination type.
  - For a conversion from `double` to `float`, the `double` value is rounded to the nearest `float` value. If the `double` value is too small to represent as a `float`, the result becomes zero with the same sign as the value. If the magnitude of the `double` value is too large to represent as a `float`, the result becomes `infinity` with the same sign as the value. If the `double` value is `NaN`, the result is also `NaN`.
  - For a conversion from `float` or `double` to `decimal`, the source value is converted to `decimal` representation and rounded to the nearest number if required (§9.3.8).
    - If the source value is too small to represent as a `decimal`, the result becomes zero, preserving the sign of the original value if `decimal` supports signed zero values.
    - If the source value's magnitude is too large to represent as a `decimal`, or that value is `infinity`, the result is `infinity` preserving the sign of the original value, if the `decimal` representation supports infinities; otherwise a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.
    - If the source value is `NaN`, the result is `NaN` if the decimal representation supports `NaN`s; otherwise a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.
  - For a conversion from `decimal` to `float` or `double`, the `decimal` value is rounded to the nearest `double` or `float` value. If the source value's magnitude is too large to represent in the target type, or that value is `infinity`, the result is `infinity` preserving the sign of the original value. If the source value is `NaN`, the result is `NaN`. While this conversion may lose precision, it never causes an exception to be thrown.

> [!NOTE]
> The `decimal` type is not required to support infinities or `NaN` values but may do so; its range may be smaller than the range of `float` and `double`, but is not guaranteed to be. For `decimal` representations without infinities or `NaN` values, and with a range smaller than `float`, the result of a conversion from `decimal` to either `float` or `double` will never be `infinity` or `NaN`.

### Explicit enumeration conversions

The explicit enumeration conversions are:

- From `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal` to any *enum-type*.
- From any *enum-type* to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, or `decimal`.
- From any *enum-type* to any other *enum-type*.

An explicit enumeration conversion between two types is processed by treating any participating *enum-type* as the underlying type of that *enum-type*, and then performing an implicit or explicit numeric conversion between the resulting types. [*Example*: Given an *enum-type *E with and underlying type of int, a conversion from E to byte is processed as an explicit numeric conversion (§11.3.2) from int to byte, and a conversion from byte to E is processed as an implicit numeric conversion (§11.2.3) from byte to int. *end example*]

### Explicit nullable conversions

The explicit nullable conversions are those nullable conversions (§11.6.1) derived from explicit and implicit predefined conversions.

### Explicit reference conversions

The explicit reference conversions are:

- From `object` and `dynamic` to any other *reference-type*.
- From any *class-type* `S` to any *class-type* `T`, provided `S` is a base class of `T`.
- From any *class-type* `S` to any *interface-type* `T`, provided `S` is not sealed and provided `S` does not implement `T`.
- From any *interface-type* `S` to any *class-type* `T`, provided `T` is not sealed or provided `T` implements `S`.
- From any *interface-type* `S` to any *interface-type* `T`, provided `S` is not derived from `T`.
- From an *array-type* `S` with an element type `SE` to an *array-type* `T` with an element type `TE`, provided all of the following are true:
  - `S` and `T` differ only in element type. In other words, `S` and `T` have the same number of dimensions.
  - An explicit reference conversion exists from `SE` to `TE`.
- From `System.Array` and the interfaces it implements, to any *array-type*.
- From a single-dimensional *array-type* `S[]` to `System.Collections.Generic.IList<T>`, `System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<T>`, and its base interfaces, provided that there is an identity conversion or explicit reference conversion from `S` to `T`.
- From `System.Collections.Generic.IList<S>`, `System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<S>`, and their base interfaces to a single-dimensional array type `T[]`, provided that there is an identity conversion or explicit reference conversion from `S` to `T`.
- From `System.Delegate` and the interfaces it implements to any *delegate-type*.
- From a reference type `S` to a reference type `T` if it has an explicit reference conversion from `S` to a reference type `T0` and `T0` and there is an identity conversion from `T0` to `T`.
- From a reference type `S` to an interface or delegate type `T` if it there is an explicit reference conversion from `S` to an interface or delegate type `T0` and either `T0` is variance-convertible to `T` or `T` is variance-convertible to `T0` (§18.2.3.3).
- From `D<S1…S>` to `D<T1…Tn>` where `D<X1…Xn>` is a generic delegate type, `D<S1…Sn>` is not compatible with or identical to `D<T1…Tn>`, and for each type parameter `Xi` of `D` the following holds:
  - If `Xi` is invariant, then `Si` is identical to `Ti`.
  - If `Xi` is covariant, then there is an identity conversion, implicit reference conversion or explicit reference conversion from `Si` to `Ti`.
  - If `Xi` is contravariant, then `Si` and `Ti` are either identical or both reference types.
- Explicit conversions involving type parameters that are known to be reference types. For more details on explicit conversions involving type parameters, see §11.3.8.

The explicit reference conversions are those conversions between *reference-type*s that require run-time checks to ensure they are correct.

For an explicit reference conversion to succeed at run-time, the value of the source operand shall be `null`, or the type of the object referenced by the source operand shall be a type that can be converted to the destination type by an implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7). If an explicit reference conversion fails, a `System.InvalidCastException` is thrown.

Reference conversions, implicit or explicit, never change the referential identity of the object being converted. 

> [!NOTE]
> In other words, while a reference conversion can change the type of the reference, it never changes the type or value of the object being referred to.

### Unboxing conversions

An unboxing conversion permits a *reference-type* to be explicitly converted to a *value-type*. The following unboxing conversions exist:

- From the type `object` to any *value-type*.
- From the type `System.ValueType` to any *value-type*.
- From the type `System.Enum` to any *enum-type*.
- From any *interface-type* to any *non-nullable-value-type* that implements the *interface-type*.
- From any *interface-type* `I` to any *non-nullable-value-type* where there is an unboxing conversion from an *interface-type* `I0` to the *non-nullable-value-type* and an identity conversion from `I` to `I0`.
- From any *interface-type* `I` to any *non-nullable-value-type* where there is an unboxing conversion from an *interface-type* `I0` to the *non-nullable-value-type* and either either `I0` is variance-convertible to `I` or `I` is variance-convertible to `I0` (§18.2.3.3).
- From any *reference-type* to any *nullable-value-type* where there is an unboxing conversion from *reference-type* to the underlying *non-nullable-value-type* of the *nullable-value-type*.
- From a type parameter which is not known to be a value type to any type such that the conversion is permitted by §11.3.8.

An unboxing operation to a *non-nullable-value-type* consists of first checking that the object instance is a boxed value of the given *non-nullable-value-type*, and then copying the value out of the instance.

Unboxing to a *nullable-value-type* produces the null value of the *nullable-value-type* if the source operand is `null`, or the wrapped result of unboxing the object instance to the underlying type of the *nullable-value-type* otherwise.

> [!NOTE]
> Referring to the imaginary boxing class described in §11.2.8, an unboxing conversion of an object box to a *value-type* `S` consists of executing the expression `((S_Boxing)box).value`. Thus, the statements
> 
> ```csharp
> object box = new S();
> S s = (S)box;
> ```
> 
> conceptually correspond to
> 
> ```csharp
> object box = new S_Boxing(new S());
> S s = ((S_Boxing)box).value;
> ```

For an unboxing conversion to a given *non-nullable-value-type* to succeed at run-time, the value of the source operand shall be a reference to a boxed value of that *non-nullable-value-type*. If the source operand is `null` a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown. If the source operand is a reference to an incompatible object, a `System.InvalidCastException` is thrown.

For an unboxing conversion to a given *nullable-value-type* to succeed at run-time, the value of the source operand shall be either `null` or a reference to a boxed value of the underlying *non-nullable-value-type* of the *nullable-value-type*. If the source operand is a reference to an incompatible object, a `System.InvalidCastException` is thrown.

### Explicit dynamic conversions

An explicit dynamic conversion exists from an expression of type `dynamic` to any type `T`. The conversion is dynamically bound (§12.3.3), which means that an explicit conversion will be sought at run-time from the run-time type of the expression to `T`. If no conversion is found, a run-time exception is thrown.

If dynamic binding of the conversion is not desired, the expression can be first converted to object, and then to the desired type.

[*Example*: Assume the following class is defined:

```csharp
class C
{
    int i;

    public C (int i) { this.i = i; }

    public static explicit operator C (string s)
    {
        return new C (int.Parse (s));
    }
}
```

The following illustrates explicit dynamic conversions:

```csharp
object o = "1";
dynamic d = "2";

var c1 = (C)o; // Compiles, but explicit reference conversion fails
var c2 = (C)d; // Compiles and user defined conversion succeeds
```

The best conversion of `o` to `C` is found at compile-time to be an explicit reference conversion. This fails at run-time, because “1” is not in fact a `C`. The conversion of `d` to `C` however, as an explicit dynamic conversion, is suspended to run-time, where a user defined conversion from the run-time type of `d` – `string` – to `C` is found, and succeeds. *end example*]

### Explicit conversions involving type parameters

For a *type-parameter* `T` that is known to be a reference type (§15.2.5), the following explicit reference conversions (§11.3.5) exist:

- From the effective base class `C` of `T` to `T` and from any base class of `C` to `T`.
- From any *interface-type* to `T`.
- From `T` to any *interface-type* `I` provided there isn’t already an implicit reference conversion from `T` to `I`.
- From a *type-parameter* `U` to `T` provided that `T` depends on `U` (§15.2.5).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Since `T` is known to be a reference type, within the scope of `T`, the run-time type of `U` will always be a reference type, even if `U` is not known to be a reference type at compile-time.

For a *type-parameter* `T` that is *not* known to be a reference type (§15.2.5), the following conversions involving `T` are considered to be unboxing conversions (§11.3.6) at compile-time. At run-time, if `T` is a value type, the conversion is executed as an unboxing conversion. At run-time, if `T` is a reference type, the conversion is executed as an explicit reference conversion or identity conversion.

- From the effective base class `C` of `T` to `T` and from any base class of `C` to `T`. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > `C` will be one of the types `System.Object`, `System.ValueType`, or `System.Enum` (otherwise `T` would be known to be a reference type).
- From any *interface-type* to `T`.

For a *type-parameter* `T` that is *not* known to be a reference type (§15.2.5), the following explicit conversions exist:

- From `T` to any *interface-type* `I` provided there is not already an implicit conversion from `T` to `I`. This conversion consists of an implicit boxing conversion (§11.2.8) from `T` to `object` followed by an explicit reference conversion from `object` to `I`. At run-time, if `T` is a value type, the conversion is executed as a boxing conversion followed by an explicit reference conversion. At run-time, if `T` is a reference type, the conversion is executed as an explicit reference conversion.
- From a type parameter `U` to `T` provided that `T` depends on `U` (§15.2.5). At run-time, if `T` is a value type and U is a reference type, the conversion is executed as an unboxing conversion. At run-time, if both `T` and `U` are value types, then `T` and `U` are necessarily the same type and no conversion is performed. At run-time, if `T` is a reference type, then `U` is necessarily also a reference type and the conversion is executed as an explicit reference conversion or identity conversion.

In all cases, the rules ensure that a conversion is executed as an unboxing conversion if and only if at run-time the conversion is from a reference type to a value type.

The above rules do not permit a direct explicit conversion from an unconstrained type parameter to a non-interface type, which might be surprising. The reason for this rule is to prevent confusion and make the semantics of such conversions clear. [*Example*: Consider the following declaration:

```csharp
class X<T>
{
    public static long F (T t)
    {
        return (long) t; // Error
    }
}
```

If the direct explicit conversion of t to long were permitted, one might easily expect that `X<int>.F(7)` would return `7L`. However, it would not, because the standard numeric conversions are only considered when the types are known to be numeric at binding-time. In order to make the semantics clear, the above example must instead be written:

```csharp
class X<T>
{
    public static long F (T t)
    {
        return (long) (object) t; // Ok, but will only work when T is long
    }
}
```

This code will now compile but executing `X<int>.F(7)` would then throw an exception at run-time, since a boxed `int` cannot be converted directly to a `long`. *end example*]

### User-defined explicit conversions

A user-defined explicit conversion consists of an optional standard explicit conversion, followed by execution of a user-defined implicit or explicit conversion operator, followed by another optional standard explicit conversion. The exact rules for evaluating user-defined explicit conversions are described in §11.5.5.

## Standard conversions

### General

The standard conversions are those pre-defined conversions that can occur as part of a user-defined conversion.

### Standard implicit conversions

The following implicit conversions are classified as standard implicit conversions:

- Identity conversions (§11.2.2)
- Implicit numeric conversions (§11.2.3)
- Implicit nullable conversions (§11.2.5)
- Null literal conversions (§11.2.6)
- Implicit reference conversions (§11.2.7)
- Boxing conversions (§11.2.8)
- Implicit constant expression conversions (§11.2.10)
- Implicit conversions involving type parameters (§11.2.11)

The standard implicit conversions specifically exclude user-defined implicit conversions.

### Standard explicit conversions

The standard explicit conversions are all standard implicit conversions plus the subset of the explicit conversions for which an opposite standard implicit conversion exists. \

> [!NOTE]
> In other words, if a standard implicit conversion exists from a type `A` to a type `B`, then a standard explicit conversion exists from type `A` to type `B` and from type `B` to type `A`.

## User-defined conversions

### General

C# allows the pre-defined implicit and explicit conversions to be augmented by ***user-defined conversions***. User-defined conversions are introduced by declaring conversion operators (§15.10.4) in class and struct types.

### Permitted user-defined conversions

C# permits only certain user-defined conversions to be declared. In particular, it is not possible to redefine an already existing implicit or explicit conversion.

For a given source type `S` and target type `T`, if `S` or `T` are nullable value types, let `S0` and `T0` refer to their underlying types, otherwise `S0` and `T0` are equal to `S` and `T` respectively. A class or struct is permitted to declare a conversion from a source type `S` to a target type `T` only if all of the following are true:

- `S0` and `T0` are different types.
- Either `S0` or `T0` is the class or struct type in which the operator declaration takes place.
- Neither `S0` nor `T0` is an *interface-type*.
- Excluding user-defined conversions, a conversion does not exist from `S` to `T` or from `T` to `S`.

The restrictions that apply to user-defined conversions are specified in §15.10.4.

### Evaluation of user-defined conversions

A user-defined conversion converts a ***source expression***, which may have a **source type**, to another type, called the ***target type***. Evaluation of a user-defined conversion centers on finding the ***most-specific*** user-defined conversion operator for the source expression and target type. This determination is broken into several steps:

- Finding the set of classes and structs from which user-defined conversion operators will be considered. This set consists of the source type and its base classes, if the source type exists, along with the target type and its base classes. For this purpose it is assumed that only classes and structs can declare user-defined operators, and that non-class types have no base classes. Also, if either the source or target type is a nullable-value-type, their underlying type is used instead.
- From that set of types, determining which user-defined and lifted conversion operators are applicable. For a conversion operator to be applicable, it shall be possible to perform a standard conversion (§11.4) from the source expression to the operand type of the operator, and it shall be possible to perform a standard conversion from the result type of the operator to the target type.
- From the set of applicable user-defined operators, determining which operator is unambiguously the most-specific. In general terms, the most-specific operator is the operator whose operand type is “closest” to the source expression and whose result type is “closest” to the target type. User-defined conversion operators are preferred over lifted conversion operators. The exact rules for establishing the most-specific user-defined conversion operator are defined in the following subclauses.

Once a most-specific user-defined conversion operator has been identified, the actual execution of the user-defined conversion involves up to three steps:

- First, if required, performing a standard conversion from the source expression to the operand type of the user-defined or lifted conversion operator.
- Next, invoking the user-defined or lifted conversion operator to perform the conversion.
- Finally, if required, performing a standard conversion from the result type of the user-defined conversion operator to the target type.

Evaluation of a user-defined conversion never involves more than one user-defined or lifted conversion operator. In other words, a conversion from type `S` to type `T` will never first execute a user-defined conversion from `S` to `X` and then execute a user-defined conversion from `X` to `T`.

Exact definitions of evaluation of user-defined implicit or explicit conversions are given in the following subclauses. The definitions make use of the following terms:
- If a standard implicit conversion (§11.4.2) exists from a type `A` to a type `B`, and if neither `A` nor `B` are *interface-type*s, then `A` is said to be ***encompassed by*** `B`, and `B` is said to ***encompass*** `A`.
- If a standard implicit conversion (§11.4.2) exists from an expression `E` to a type `B`, and if neither `B` nor the type of `E` (if it has one) are *interface-type*s, then `E` is said to be ***encompassed by*** `B`, and `B` is said to ***encompass*** `E`.
- The ***most-encompassing type*** in a set of types is the one type that encompasses all other types in the set. If no single type encompasses all other types, then the set has no most-encompassing type. In more intuitive terms, the most-encompassing type is the “largest” type in the set—the one type to which each of the other types can be implicitly converted.
- The ***most-encompassed type*** in a set of types is the one type that is encompassed by all other types in the set. If no single type is encompassed by all other types, then the set has no most-encompassed type. In more intuitive terms, the most-encompassed type is the “smallest” type in the set—the one type that can be implicitly converted to each of the other types.

### User-defined implicit conversions

A user-defined implicit conversion from an expression `E` to a type `T` is processed as follows:

- Determine the types `S`, `S0` and `T0`.
  - If `E` has a type, let `S` be that type.
  - If `S` or `T` are nullable value types, let `SU` and `TU` be their underlying types, otherwise let `SU` and `TU` be `S` and `T`, respectively.
  - If `SU` or `TU` are type parameters, let `S0` and `T0` be their effective base classes, otherwise let `S0` and `T0` be `SU` and `TU`, respectively.
- Find the set of types, `D`, from which user-defined conversion operators will be considered. This set consists of `S0` (if `S0` exists and is a class or struct), the base classes of `S0` (if `S0` exists and is a class), and `T0` (if `T0` is a class or struct). A type is added to the set `D` only if an identity conversion to another type already included in the set doesn’t exist.
- Find the set of applicable user-defined and lifted conversion operators, `U`. This set consists of the user-defined and lifted implicit conversion operators declared by the classes or structs in `D` that convert from a type encompassing `E` to a type encompassed by `T`. If `U` is empty, the conversion is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.
- Find the most-specific source type, `SX`, of the operators in `U`:
  - If `S` exists and any of the operators in `U` convert from S, then `SX` is `S`.
  - Otherwise, `SX` is the most-encompassed type in the combined set of source types of the operators in `U`. If exactly one most-encompassed type cannot be found, then the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
- Find the most-specific target type, `TX`, of the operators in `U`:
  - If any of the operators in `U` convert to `T`, then `TX` is `T`.
  - Otherwise, `TX` is the most-encompassing type in the combined set of target types of the operators in `U`. If exactly one most-encompassing type cannot be found, then the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
- Find the most-specific conversion operator:
  - If `U` contains exactly one user-defined conversion operator that converts from `SX` to `TX`, then this is the most-specific conversion operator.
  - Otherwise, if `U `contains exactly one lifted conversion operator that converts from `SX` to `TX`, then this is the most-specific conversion operator.
  - Otherwise, the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
- Finally, apply the conversion:
  - If E does not already have the type `SX`, then a standard implicit conversion from `E` to `SX` is performed.
  - The most-specific conversion operator is invoked to convert from `SX` to `TX`.
  - If `TX` is not `T`, then a standard implicit conversion from `TX` to `T` is performed.

A user-defined implicit conversion from a type `S` to a type `T` exists if a user-defined implicit conversion exists from a variable of type `S` to `T`.

### User-defined explicit conversions

A user-defined explicit conversion from an expression `E` to a type `T` is processed as follows:

- Determine the types `S`, `S0` and `T0`.
  - If `E` has a type, let `S` be that type.
  - If `S` or `T` are nullable value types, let `SU` and `TU` be their underlying types, otherwise let `SU` and `TU` be `S` and `T`, respectively.
  - If `SU` or `TU` are type parameters, let `S0` and `T0` be their effective base classes, otherwise let `S0` and `T0` be `SU` and `TU`, respectively.
- Find the set of types, `D`, from which user-defined conversion operators will be considered. This set consists of `S0` (if `S0` exists and is a class or struct), the base classes of `S0` (if `S0` exists and is a class), `T0` (if `T0` is a class or struct), and the base classes of `T0` (if `T0` is a class). A type is added to the set `D` only if an identity conversion to another type already included in the set doesn’t exist.
- Find the set of applicable user-defined and lifted conversion operators, `U`. This set consists of the user-defined and lifted implicit or explicit conversion operators declared by the classes or structs in `D` that convert from a type encompassing `E` or encompassed by `S` (if it exists) to a type encompassing or encompassed by `T`. If `U` is empty, the conversion is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.
- Find the most-specific source type, `SX`, of the operators in `U`:
  - If `S` exists and any of the operators in `U` convert from `S`, then `SX` is `S`.
  - Otherwise, if any of the operators in `U` convert from types that encompass E, then `SX` is the most-encompassed type in the combined set of source types of those operators. If no most-encompassed type can be found, then the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
  - Otherwise, `SX` is the most-encompassing type in the combined set of source types of the operators in `U`. If exactly one most-encompassing type cannot be found, then the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
- Find the most-specific target type, `TX`, of the operators in `U`:
  - If any of the operators in `U` convert to `T`, then `TX` is `T`.
  - Otherwise, if any of the operators in `U` convert to types that are encompassed by `T`, then `TX` is the most-encompassing type in the combined set of target types of those operators. If exactly one most-encompassing type cannot be found, then the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
  - Otherwise, `TX` is the most-encompassed type in the combined set of target types of the operators in `U`. If no most-encompassed type can be found, then the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
- Find the most-specific conversion operator:
  - If `U` contains exactly one user-defined conversion operator that converts from `SX` to `TX`, then this is the most-specific conversion operator.
  - Otherwise, if `U` contains exactly one lifted conversion operator that converts from `SX` to `TX`, then this is the most-specific conversion operator.
  - Otherwise, the conversion is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
- Finally, apply the conversion:
  - If `E` does not already have the type `SX`, then a standard explicit conversion from `E` to `SX` is performed.
  - The most-specific user-defined conversion operator is invoked to convert from `SX` to `TX`.
  - If `TX` is not `T`, then a standard explicit conversion from `TX` to `T` is performed.

A user-defined explicit conversion from a type `S` to a type `T` exists if a user-defined explicit conversion exists from a variable of type `S` to `T`.

## Conversions involving nullable types

### Nullable Conversions

***Nullable conversions*** permit predefined conversions that operate on non-nullable value types to also be used with nullable forms of those types. For each of the predefined implicit or explicit conversions that convert from a non-nullable value type `S` to a non-nullable value type `T` (§11.2.2, §11.2.3, §11.2.4, §11.2.10, §11.3.2 and §11.3.3), the following nullable conversions exist:

- An implicit or explicit conversion from `S?` to `T?`
- An implicit or explicit conversion from `S` to `T?`
- An explicit conversion from `S?` to `T`.

A nullable conversion is itself classified as an implicit or explicit conversion.

Certain nullable conversions are classified as standard conversions and can occur as part of a user-defined conversion. Specifically, all implicit nullable conversions are classified as standard implicit conversions (§11.4.2), and those explicit nullable conversions that satisfy the requirements of §11.4.3 are classified as standard explicit conversions.

Evaluation of a nullable conversion based on an underlying conversion from `S` to `T` proceeds as follows:

- If the nullable conversion is from `S?` to `T?`:
  - If the source value is `null` (`HasValue` property is `false`), the result is the `null` value of type `T?`.
  - Otherwise, the conversion is evaluated as an unwrapping from `S?` to `S`, followed by the underlying conversion from `S` to `T`, followed by a wrapping from `T` to `T?`.
- If the nullable conversion is from `S` to `T?`, the conversion is evaluated as the underlying conversion from `S` to `T` followed by a wrapping from `T` to `T?`.
- If the nullable conversion is from `S?` to `T`, the conversion is evaluated as an unwrapping from `S?` to `S` followed by the underlying conversion from `S` to `T`.

### Lifted conversions

Given a user-defined conversion operator that converts from a non-nullable value type `S` to a non-nullable value type `T`, a ***lifted conversion operator*** exists that converts from `S?` to `T?`. This lifted conversion operator performs an unwrapping from `S?` to `S` followed by the user-defined conversion from `S` to `T` followed by a wrapping from `T` to `T?`, except that a null valued `S?` converts directly to a null valued `T?`. A lifted conversion operator has the same implicit or explicit classification as its underlying user-defined conversion operator.

## Anonymous function conversions

### General

An *anonymous-method-expression* or *lambda-expression* is classified as an anonymous function (§12.16). The expression does not have a type, but can be implicitly converted to a compatible delegate type. Some lambda expressions may also be implicitly converted to a compatible expression-tree type.

For the purpose of brevity, this subclause uses the short form for the task types `Task` and `Task<T>` (§15.15.1).

Specifically, an anonymous function `F` is compatible with a delegate type `D` provided:

- If `F` contains an *anonymous-function-signature*, then `D` and `F` have the same number of parameters.
- If `F` does not contain an *anonymous-function-signature*, then `D` may have zero or more parameters of any type, as long as no parameter of `D` has the `out` parameter modifier.
- If `F` has an explicitly typed parameter list, each parameter in `D` has the same type and modifiers as the corresponding parameter in `F`.
- If `F` has an implicitly typed parameter list, `D` has no `ref` or `out` parameters.
- If the body of `F` is an expression, and *either* `D` has a `void` return type *or* `F` is `async` and `D` has the return type `Task`, then when each parameter of `F` is given the type of the corresponding parameter in `D`, the body of `F` is a valid expression (w.r.t §12) that would be permitted as a *statement-expression* (§13.7).
- If the body of `F` is a statement block, and *either* `D` has a `void` return type *or* `F` is `async` and `D` has the return type `Task`, then when each parameter of `F` is given the type of the corresponding parameter in `D`, the body of `F` is a valid statement block (w.r.t §13.3) in which no return statement specifies an expression.
- If the body of `F` is an expression, and *either* `F` is non-async and `D` has a non-void return type `T`, *or* `F` is `async` and `D` has a return type `Task<T>`, then when each parameter of `F` is given the type of the corresponding parameter in `D`, the body of `F` is a valid expression (w.r.t §12) that is implicitly convertible to `T`.
- If the body of `F` is a statement block, and *either* `F` is non-async and `D` has a non-void return type `T`, *or* `F` is `async` and `D` has a return type `Task<T>`, then when each parameter of F is given the type of the corresponding parameter in `D`, the body of `F` is a valid statement block (w.r.t §13.3) with a non-reachable end point in which each return statement specifies an expression that is implicitly convertible to `T`.

[*Example*: The following examples illustrate these rules:

```csharp
delegate void D (int x);

D d1 = delegate { }; // Ok
D d2 = delegate () { }; // Error, signature mismatch
D d3 = delegate (long x) { }; // Error, signature mismatch
D d4 = delegate (int x) { }; // Ok
D d5 = delegate (int x) { return; }; // Ok
D d6 = delegate (int x) { return x; }; // Error, return type mismatch

delegate void E (out int x);

E e1 = delegate { }; // Error, E has an out parameter
E e2 = delegate (out int x) { x = 1; }; // Ok
E e3 = delegate (ref int x) { x = 1; }; // Error, signature mismatch

delegate int P (params int[] a);

P p1 = delegate { }; // Error, end of block reachable
P p2 = delegate { return; }; // Error, return type mismatch
P p3 = delegate { return 1; }; // Ok
P p4 = delegate { return "Hello"; }; // Error, return type mismatch
P p5 = delegate (int[] a)
{ // Ok
    return a[0];
};
P p6 = delegate (params int[] a)
{ // Error, params modifier
    return a[0];
};
P p7 = delegate (int[] a)
{ // Error, return type mismatch
    if (a.Length > 0) return a[0];
    return "Hello";
};

delegate object Q (params int[] a);

Q q1 = delegate (int[] a)
{ // Ok
    if (a.Length > 0) return a[0];
    return "Hello";
};
```

*end example*]

[*Example*: The examples that follow use a generic delegate type `Func<A,R>` that represents a function that takes an argument of type `A` and returns a value of type `R`:

```csharp
delegate R Func<A,R>(A arg);
```

In the assignments

```csharp
Func<int, int> f1 = x => x + 1; // Ok

Func<int, double> f2 = x => x + 1; // Ok

Func<double, int> f3 = x => x + 1; // Error

Func<int, Task<int>> f4 = async x => x + 1; // Ok
```

the parameter and return types of each anonymous function are determined from the type of the variable to which the anonymous function is assigned.

The first assignment successfully converts the anonymous function to the delegate type `Func<int,int>` because, when `x` is given type `int`, `x + 1` is a valid expression that is implicitly convertible to type `int`.

Likewise, the second assignment successfully converts the anonymous function to the delegate type `Func<int,double>` because the result of `x + 1` (of type `int`) is implicitly convertible to type `double`.

However, the third assignment is a compile-time error because, when `x` is given type `double`, the result of `x + 1` (of type `double`) is not implicitly convertible to type `int`.

The fourth assignment successfully converts the anonymous async function to the delegate type `Func<int, Task<int>>` because the result of `x + 1` (of type `int`) is implicitly convertible to the effective return type `int` of the async lambda, which has a return type `Task<int>`. *end example*]

A lambda expression `F` is compatible with an expression tree type `Expression<D>` if `F` is compatible with the delegate type `D`. This does not apply to anonymous methods, only lambda expressions.

Certain lambda expressions cannot be converted to expression tree types: Even though the conversion *exists*, it fails at compile-time. This is the case if the lambda expression:

- Has a *block* body
- Contains simple or compound assignment operators
- Contains a dynamically bound expression
- Is async

Anonymous functions may influence overload resolution, and participate in type inference. See §12.6 for further details.

### Evaluation of anonymous function conversions to delegate types

Conversion of an anonymous function to a delegate type produces a delegate instance that references the anonymous function and the (possibly empty) set of captured outer variables that are active at the time of the evaluation. When the delegate is invoked, the body of the anonymous function is executed. The code in the body is executed using the set of captured outer variables referenced by the delegate. A *delegate-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.6) can be used as an alternate syntax for converting an anonymous method to a delegate type.

The invocation list of a delegate produced from an anonymous function contains a single entry. The exact target object and target method of the delegate are unspecified. In particular, it is unspecified whether the target object of the delegate is null, the this value of the enclosing function member, or some other object.

Conversions of semantically identical anonymous functions with the same (possibly empty) set of captured outer variable instances to the same delegate types are permitted (but not required) to return the same delegate instance. The term semantically identical is used here to mean that execution of the anonymous functions will, in all cases, produce the same effects given the same arguments. This rule permits code such as the following to be optimized.

```csharp
delegate double Function (double x);

class Test
{
    static double[] Apply (double[] a, Function f)
    {
        double[] result = new double[a.Length];
        for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i++) result[i] = f (a[i]);
        return result;
    }

    static void F (double[] a, double[] b)
    {
        a = Apply (a, (double x) => Math.Sin (x));
        b = Apply (b, (double y) => Math.Sin (y));
        …
    }
}
```

Since the two anonymous function delegates have the same (empty) set of captured outer variables, and since the anonymous functions are semantically identical, the compiler is permitted to have the delegates refer to the same target method. Indeed, the compiler is permitted to return the very same delegate instance from both anonymous function expressions.

### Evaluation of anonymous function conversions to expression tree types

Conversion of an anonymous function to an expression-tree type produces an expression tree (§9.6). More precisely, evaluation of the anonymous-function conversion produces an object structure that represents the structure of the anonymous function itself. The precise structure of the expression tree, as well as the exact process for creating it, are implementation-defined.

## Method group conversions

An implicit conversion exists from a method group (§12.2) to a compatible delegate type (§20.4). If `D` is a delegate type, and `E` is an expression that is classified as a method group, then `D` is compatible with `E` if and only if `E` contains at least one method that is applicable in its normal form (§12.6.4.2) to any argument list (§12.6.2) having types and modifiers matching the parameter types and modifiers of `D`, as described in the following.

The compile-time application of the conversion from a method group `E` to a delegate type `D` is described in the following. Note that the existence of an implicit conversion from `E` to `D` does not guarantee that the compile-time application of the conversion will succeed without error.

- A single method `M` is selected corresponding to a method invocation (§12.7.6.2) of the form `E(A)`, with the following modifications:
  - The argument list `A` is a list of expressions, each classified as a variable and with the type and modifier (`ref` or `out`) of the corresponding parameter in the *formal-parameter-list* of `D` – excepting parameters of type `dynamic`, where the corresponding expression has the type `object` instead of `dynamic`.
  - The candidate methods considered are only those methods that are applicable in their normal form and do not omit any optional parameters (§12.6.4.2). Thus, candidate methods are ignored if they are applicable only in their expanded form, or if one or more of their optional parameters do not have a corresponding parameter in `D`.
- A conversion is considered to exist if the algorithm of §12.7.6.2 produces a single best method `M` having the same number of parameters as `D`.
- Even if the conversion exists, a compile-time error occurs if the selected method `M` is not compatible (§20.4) with the delegate type `D`.
- If the selected method `M` is an instance method, the instance expression associated with `E` determines the target object of the delegate.
- If the selected method `M` is an extension method which is denoted by means of a member access on an instance expression, that instance expression determines the target object of the delegate.
- The result of the conversion is a value of type `D`, namely a delegate that refers to the selected method and target object.

[*Example*: The following demonstrates method group conversions:

```csharp
delegate string D1 (object o);

delegate object D2 (string s);

delegate object D3 ();

delegate string D4 (object o, params object[] a);

delegate string D5 (int i);

class Test
{
    static string F (object o) {…}

    static void G ()
    {
        D1 d1 = F; // Ok
        D2 d2 = F; // Ok
        D3 d3 = F; // Error – not applicable
        D4 d4 = F; // Error – not applicable in normal form
        D5 d5 = F; // Error – applicable but not compatible

    }
}
```

The assignment to `d1` implicitly converts the method group `F` to a value of type `D1`.

The assignment to `d2` shows how it is possible to create a delegate to a method that has less derived (contra-variant) parameter types and a more derived (covariant) return type.

The assignment to `d3` shows how no conversion exists if the method is not applicable.

The assignment to `d4` shows how the method must be applicable in its normal form.

The assignment to `d5` shows how parameter and return types of the delegate and method are allowed to differ only for reference types.

*end example*]

As with all other implicit and explicit conversions, the `cast` operator can be used to explicitly perform a particular conversion. [*Example*: Thus, the example

```csharp
object obj = new EventHandler(myDialog.OkClick);
```

could instead be written

```csharp
object obj = (EventHandler)myDialog.OkClick;
```

*end example*]

A method group conversion can refer to a generic method, either by explicitly specifying type arguments within `E`, or via type inference (§12.6.3). If type inference is used, the parameter types of the delegate are used as argument types in the inference process. The return type of the delegate is not used for inference. Whether the type arguments are specified or inferred, they are part of the method group conversion process; these are the type arguments used to invoke the target method when the resulting delegate is invoked. [*Example*:

```csharp
delegate int D (string s, int i);
delegate int E ();

class X
{
    public static T F<T> (string s, T t) {…}
    public static T G<T> () {…}

    static void Main()
    {
        D d1 = F<int>; // Ok, type argument given explicitly

        D d2 = F; // Ok, int inferred as type argument

        E e1 = G<int>; // Ok, type argument given explicitly

        E e2 = G; // Error, cannot infer from return type
    }
}
```

*end example*]

Method groups may influence overload resolution, and participate in type inference. See §12.6 for further details.

The run-time evaluation of a method group conversion proceeds as follows:

- If the method selected at compile-time is an instance method, or it is an extension method which is accessed as an instance method, the target object of the delegate is determined from the instance expression associated with `E`:
  - The instance expression is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.
  - If the instance expression is of a *reference-type*, the value computed by the instance expression becomes the target object. If the selected method is an instance method and the target object is null, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
  - If the instance expression is of a *value-type*, a boxing operation (§11.2.8) is performed to convert the value to an object, and this object becomes the target object.
- Otherwise, the selected method is part of a static method call, and the target object of the delegate is `null`.
- A delegate instance of delegate type `D` is obtained with a reference to the method that was determined at compile-time and a reference to the target object computed above, as follows:
  - The conversion is permitted (but not required) to use an existing delegate instance that already contains these references.
  - If an existing instance was not reused, a new one is created (§20.5). If there is not enough memory available to allocate the new instance, a `System.OutOfMemoryException` is thrown. Otherwise the instance is initialized with the given references.

# Expressions

## General

An expression is a sequence of operators and operands. This clause defines the syntax, order of evaluation of operands and operators, and meaning of expressions.

## Expression classifications

### General

An expression is classified as one of the following:

- A value. Every value has an associated type.
- A variable. Every variable has an associated type, namely the declared type of the variable.
- A namespace. An expression with this classification can only appear as the left-hand side of a *member-access* (§12.7.5). In any other context, an expression classified as a namespace causes a compile-time error.
- A type. An expression with this classification can only appear as the left-hand side of a *member-access* (§12.7.5). In any other context, an expression classified as a type causes a compile-time error.
- A method group, which is a set of overloaded methods resulting from a member lookup (§12.5). A method group may have an associated instance expression and an associated type argument list. When an instance method is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8). A method group is permitted in an *invocation-expression* (§12.7.6) or a *delegate-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.6), and can be implicitly converted to a compatible delegate type (§11.8). In any other context, an expression classified as a method group causes a compile-time error.
- A `null` literal. An expression with this classification can be implicitly converted to a reference type or nullable value type
- An anonymous function. An expression with this classification can be implicitly converted to a compatible delegate type or expression tree type.
- A property access. Every property access has an associated type, namely the type of the property. Furthermore, a property access may have an associated instance expression. When an accessor (the get or set block) of an instance property access is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8).
- An event access. Every event access has an associated type, namely the type of the event. Furthermore, an event access may have an associated instance expression. An event access may appear as the left-hand operand of the `+=` and `-=` operators (§12.18.4). In any other context, an expression classified as an event access causes a compile-time error. When an accessor (the add or remove block) of an instance event access is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8).
- An indexer access. Every indexer access has an associated type, namely the element type of the indexer. Furthermore, an indexer access has an associated instance expression and an associated argument list. When an accessor (the get or set block) of an indexer access is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8), and the result of evaluating the argument list becomes the parameter list of the invocation.
- Nothing. This occurs when the expression is an invocation of a method with a return type of `void`. An expression classified as nothing is only valid in the context of a *statement-expression* (§13.7).

The final result of an expression is never a namespace, type, method group, or event access. Rather, as noted above, these categories of expressions are intermediate constructs that are only permitted in certain contexts.

A property access or indexer access is always reclassified as a value by performing an invocation of the *get-accessor* or the *set-accessor*. The particular accessor is determined by the context of the property or indexer access: If the access is the target of an assignment, the *set-accessor* is invoked to assign a new value (§12.18.2). Otherwise, the *get-accessor* is invoked to obtain the current value (§12.2.2).

An ***instance accessor*** is a property access on an instance, an event access on an instance, or an indexer access.

### Values of expressions

Most of the constructs that involve an expression ultimately require the expression to denote a ***value***. In such cases, if the actual expression denotes a namespace, a type, a method group, or nothing, a compile-time error occurs. However, if the expression denotes a property access, an indexer access, or a variable, the value of the property, indexer, or variable is implicitly substituted:

- The value of a variable is simply the value currently stored in the storage location identified by the variable. A variable shall be considered definitely assigned (§10.4) before its value can be obtained, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs.
- The value of a property access expression is obtained by invoking the *get-accessor* of the property. If the property has no *get-accessor*, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, a function member invocation (§12.6.6) is performed, and the result of the invocation becomes the value of the property access expression.
- The value of an indexer access expression is obtained by invoking the *get-accessor* of the indexer. If the indexer has no *get-accessor*, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, a function member invocation (§12.6.6) is performed with the argument list associated with the indexer access expression, and the result of the invocation becomes the value of the indexer access expression.

## Static and Dynamic Binding

### General

***Binding*** is the process of determining what an operation refers to, based on the type or value of expressions (arguments, operands, receivers). For instance, the binding of a method call is determined based on the type of the receiver and arguments. The binding of an operator is determined based on the type of its operands.

In C# the binding of an operation is usually determined at compile-time, based on the compile-time type of its subexpressions. Likewise, if an expression contains an error, the error is detected and reported by the compiler. This approach is known as ***static binding***.

However, if an expression is a *dynamic expression* (i.e., has the type dynamic) this indicates that any binding that it participates in should be based on its run-time type rather than the type it has at compile-time. The binding of such an operation is therefore deferred until the time where the operation is to be executed during the running of the program. This is referred to as ***dynamic binding***.

When an operation is dynamically bound, little or no checking is performed by the compiler. Instead if the run-time binding fails, errors are reported as exceptions at run-time.

The following operations in C# are subject to binding:

- Member access: `e.M`
- Method invocation: `e.M(e1,…,en)`
- Delegate invocation: `e(e1,…,en)`
- Element access: `e[e1,…,en]`
- Object creation: new `C(e1,…,en)`
- Overloaded unary operators: `+`, `-`, `!`, `~`, `++`, `--`, `true`, `false`
- Overloaded binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `??`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `==`,`!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`
- Implicit and explicit conversions

When no dynamic expressions are involved, C# defaults to static binding, which means that the compile-time types of subexpressions are used in the selection process. However, when one of the subexpressions in the operations listed above is a dynamic expression, the operation is instead dynamically bound.

### Binding-time

Static binding takes place at compile-time, whereas dynamic binding takes place at run-time. In the following subclauses, the term ***binding-time*** refers to either compile-time or run-time, depending on when the binding takes place.

[*Example*: The following illustrates the notions of static and dynamic binding and of binding-time:

```csharp
object o = 5;
dynamic d = 5;

Console.WriteLine(5); // static binding to Console.WriteLine(int)
Console.WriteLine(o); // static binding to Console.WriteLine(object)
Console.WriteLine(d); // dynamic binding to Console.WriteLine(int)
```

The first two calls are statically bound: the overload of `Console.WriteLine` is picked based on the compile-time type of their argument. Thus, the binding-time is *compile-time*.

The third call is dynamically bound: the overload of `Console.WriteLine` is picked based on the run-time type of its argument. This happens because the argument is a dynamic expression – its compile-time type is `dynamic`. Thus, the binding-time for the third call is *run-time*. *end example*]

### Dynamic binding

**This subclause is informative.**

Dynamic binding allows C# programs to interact with dynamic objects, i.e., objects that do not follow the normal rules of the C# type system. Dynamic objects may be objects from other programming languages with different types systems, or they may be objects that are programmatically setup to implement their own binding semantics for different operations.

The mechanism by which a dynamic object implements its own semantics is implementation defined. A given interface – again implementation defined – is implemented by dynamic objects to signal to the C# run-time that they have special semantics. Thus, whenever operations on a dynamic object are dynamically bound, their own binding semantics, rather than those of C# as specified in this specification, take over.

While the purpose of dynamic binding is to allow interoperation with dynamic objects, C# allows dynamic binding on all objects, whether they are dynamic or not. This allows for a smoother integration of dynamic objects, as the results of operations on them may not themselves be dynamic objects, but are still of a type unknown to the programmer at compile-time. Also, dynamic binding can help eliminate error-prone reflection-based code even when no objects involved are dynamic objects.

### Types of subexpressions

When an operation is statically bound, the type of a subexpression (e.g., a receiver, and argument, an index or an operand) is always considered to be the compile-time type of that expression.

When an operation is dynamically bound, the type of a subexpression is determined in different ways depending on the compile-time type of the subexpression:

- A subexpression of compile-time type `dynamic` is considered to have the type of the actual value that the expression evaluates to at run-time
- A subexpression whose compile-time type is a type parameter is considered to have the type which the type parameter is bound to at run-time
- Otherwise, the subexpression is considered to have its compile-time type.

## Operators

### General

Expressions are constructed from ***operands*** and ***operators***. The operators of an expression indicate which operations to apply to the operands. [*Example*: Examples of operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `new`. Examples of operands include literals, fields, local variables, and expressions. *end example*]

There are three kinds of operators:

- Unary operators. The unary operators take one operand and use either prefix notation (such as `–x`) or postfix notation (such as `x++`).
- Binary operators. The binary operators take two operands and all use infix notation (such as `x + y`).
- Ternary operator. Only one ternary operator, `?:`, exists; it takes three operands and uses infix notation (`c ? x : y`).

The order of evaluation of operators in an expression is determined by the ***precedence*** and ***associativity*** of the operators (§12.4.2).

Operands in an expression are evaluated from left to right. [*Example*: In `F(i) + G(i++) * H(i)`, method `F` is called using the old value of `i`, then method `G` is called with the old value of `i`, and, finally, method `H` is called with the new value of `i`. This is separate from and unrelated to operator precedence. *end example*]

Certain operators can be ***overloaded***. Operator overloading (§12.4.3) permits user-defined operator implementations to be specified for operations where one or both of the operands are of a user-defined class or struct type.

### Operator precedence and associativity

When an expression contains multiple operators, the ***precedence*** of the operators controls the order in which the individual operators are evaluated. 
> [!NOTE]
> For example, the expression `x + y * z` is evaluated as `x + (y * z)` because the `*` operator has higher precedence than the binary `+` operator. 

The precedence of an operator is established by the definition of its associated grammar production. 

> [!NOTE]
> For example, an *additive-expression* consists of a sequence of *multiplicative-expression*s separated by `+` or `-` operators, thus giving the `+` and `-` operators lower precedence than the `*`, `/`, and `%` operators.

> [!NOTE]
> The following table summarizes all operators in order of precedence from highest to lowest:

> 

When an operand occurs between two operators with the same precedence, the ***associativity*** of the operators controls the order in which the operations are performed:

- Except for the assignment operators and the null coalescing operator, all binary operators are ***left-associative***, meaning that operations are performed from left to right. [*Example*: `x + y + z` is evaluated as `(x + y) + z`. *end example*]
- The assignment operators, the null coalescing operator and the conditional operator (`?:`) are ***right-associative***, meaning that operations are performed from right to left. [*Example*: `x = y = z` is evaluated as `x = (y = z)`. *end example*]

Precedence and associativity can be controlled using parentheses. [*Example*: `x + y * z` first multiplies `y` by `z` and then adds the result to `x`, but `(x + y) * z` first adds `x` and `y` and then multiplies the result by `z`. *end example*]

### Operator overloading

All unary and binary operators have predefined implementations that are automatically available in any expression. In addition to the predefined implementations, user-defined implementations can be introduced by including operator declarations (§15.10) in classes and structs. User-defined operator implementations always take precedence over predefined operator implementations: Only when no applicable user-defined operators implementations exist will the predefined operator implementations be considered, as described in §12.4.4 and §12.4.5.

The ***overloadable unary operators*** are:

`+` `-` `!` `~` `++` `--` `true` `false`

> [!NOTE]
> Although `true` and `false` are not used explicitly in expressions (and therefore are not included in the precedence table in §12.4.2), they are considered operators because they are invoked in several expression contexts: Boolean expressions (§12.21) and expressions involving the conditional (§12.15) and conditional logical operators (§12.13).

The ***overloadable binary operators*** are:

`+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `&` `|` `^` `<<` `>>` `==` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=`

Only the operators listed above can be overloaded. In particular, it is not possible to overload member access, method invocation, or the `=`, `&&`, `||`, `??`, `?:`, `=>`, `checked`, `unchecked`, `new`, `typeof`, `default`, `as`, and `is` operators.

When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding compound assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded. [*Example*: An overload of operator `*` is also an overload of operator `*=`. This is described further in §12.18. *end example*] The assignment operator itself (`=`) cannot be overloaded. An assignment always performs a simple store of a value into a variable(§12.18.2).

Cast operations, such as `(T)x`, are overloaded by providing user-defined conversions (§11.5). 

> [!NOTE]
> User-defined conversions do not affect the behavior of the `is` or `as` operators.

Element access, such as `a[x]`, is not considered an overloadable operator. Instead, user-defined indexing is supported through indexers (§15.9).

In expressions, operators are referenced using operator notation, and in declarations, operators are referenced using functional notation. The following table shows the relationship between operator and functional notations for unary and binary operators. In the first entry, *op* denotes any overloadable unary prefix operator. In the second entry, *op* denotes the unary postfix `++` and `--` operators. In the third entry, *op* denotes any overloadable binary operator. 

> [!NOTE]
> For an example of overloading the `++` and `--` operators see §15.10.2.

|  **Operator notation**   | **Functional notation** |
| -----------------------  | ----------------------- |
|  *op* x                  | operator *op*(x)        |
|  x *op*                  | operator *op*(x)        |
|  x *op* y                | operator *op*(x, y)     |

User-defined operator declarations always require at least one of the parameters to be of the class or struct type that contains the operator declaration. 

> [!NOTE]
> Thus, it is not possible for a user-defined operator to have the same signature as a predefined operator.

User-defined operator declarations cannot modify the syntax, precedence, or associativity of an operator. [*Example*: The `/` operator is always a binary operator, always has the precedence level specified in §12.4.2, and is always left-associative. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> While it is possible for a user-defined operator to perform any computation it pleases, implementations that produce results other than those that are intuitively expected are strongly discouraged. For example, an implementation of operator == should compare the two operands for equality and return an appropriate bool result.

The descriptions of individual operators in §12.8 through §12.18 specify the predefined implementations of the operators and any additional rules that apply to each operator. The descriptions make use of the terms ***unary operator overload resolution***, ***binary operator overload resolution***, ***numeric promotion***, and ***lifted operators*** definitions of which are found in the following subclauses.

### Unary operator overload resolution

An operation of the form *op *x or x *op*, where *op* is an overloadable unary operator, and `x` is an expression of type `X`, is processed as follows:

- The set of candidate user-defined operators provided by `X` for the operation operator *op*(x) is determined using the rules of §12.4.6.
- If the set of candidate user-defined operators is not empty, then this becomes the set of candidate operators for the operation. Otherwise, the predefined binary operator *op* implementations, including their lifted forms, become the set of candidate operators for the operation. The predefined implementations of a given operator are specified in the description of the operator. The predefined operators provided by an enum or delegate type are only included in this set when the binding-time type—or the underlying type if it is a nullable type—of either operand is the enum or delegate type.
- The overload resolution rules of §12.6.4 are applied to the set of candidate operators to select the best operator with respect to the argument list (x), and this operator becomes the result of the overload resolution process. If overload resolution fails to select a single best operator, a binding-time error occurs.

### Binary operator overload resolution

An operation of the form x *op *y, where *op* is an overloadable binary operator, `x` is an expression of type `X`, and `y` is an expression of type `Y`, is processed as follows:

- The set of candidate user-defined operators provided by `X` and `Y` for the operation operator *op*(x, y) is determined. The set consists of the union of the candidate operators provided by `X` and the candidate operators provided by `Y`, each determined using the rules of §12.4.6. For the combined set, candidates are merged as follows:
  - If `X` and `Y` are the same type, or if `X` and `Y` are derived from a common base type, then shared candidate operators only occur in the combined set once.
  - If there is an identity conversion between `X` and `Y`, an operator *op*Y provided by `Y` has the same return type as an *op*X provided by `X` and the operand types of *op*Y have an identity conversion to the corresponding operand types of *op*X then only *op*X occurs in the set.
- If the set of candidate user-defined operators is not empty, then this becomes the set of candidate operators for the operation. Otherwise, the predefined binary operator *op* implementations, including their lifted forms, become the set of candidate operators for the operation. The predefined implementations of a given operator are specified in the description of the operator. For predefined enum and delegate operators, the only operators considered are those provided by an enum or delegate type that is the binding-time type of one of the operands.
- The overload resolution rules of §12.6.4 are applied to the set of candidate operators to select the best operator with respect to the argument list `(x, y)`, and this operator becomes the result of the overload resolution process. If overload resolution fails to select a single best operator, a binding-time error occurs.

### Candidate user-defined operators

Given a type `T` and an operation operator *op*(A), where *op* is an overloadable operator and A is an argument list, the set of candidate user-defined operators provided by `T` for operator *op*(A) is determined as follows:

- Determine the type `T0`. If `T` is a nullable value type, `T0` is its underlying type; otherwise, `T0` is equal to `T`.
- For all operator *op* declarations in `T0` and all lifted forms of such operators, if at least one operator is applicable (§12.6.4.2) with respect to the argument list `A`, then the set of candidate operators consists of all such applicable operators in `T0`.
- Otherwise, if `T0` is `object`, the set of candidate operators is empty.
- Otherwise, the set of candidate operators provided by `T0` is the set of candidate operators provided by the direct base class of `T0`, or the effective base class of `T0` if `T0` is a type parameter.

### Numeric promotions

#### General

**This subclause is informative.**

Numeric promotion consists of automatically performing certain implicit conversions of the operands of the predefined unary and binary numeric operators. Numeric promotion is not a distinct mechanism, but rather an effect of applying overload resolution to the predefined operators. Numeric promotion specifically does not affect evaluation of user-defined operators, although user-defined operators can be implemented to exhibit similar effects.

As an example of numeric promotion, consider the predefined implementations of the binary * operator:

```csharp
int operator *(int x, int y);
uint operator *(uint x, uint y);
long operator *(long x, long y);
ulong operator *(ulong x, ulong y);
float operator *(float x, float y);
double operator *(double x, double y);
decimal operator *(decimal x, decimal y);
```
When overload resolution rules (§12.6.4) are applied to this set of operators, the effect is to select the first of the operators for which implicit conversions exist from the operand types. [*Example*: For the operation `b * s`, where `b` is a `byte` and `s` is a `short`, overload resolution selects operator `*(int, int)` as the best operator. Thus, the effect is that `b` and `s` are converted to `int`, and the type of the result is `int`. Likewise, for the operation `i * d`, where `i` is an `int` and `d` is a `double`, overload resolution selects operator `*(double, double)` as the best operator. *end example*]

**End of informative text.**

#### Unary numeric promotions

**This subclause is informative.**

Unary numeric promotion occurs for the operands of the predefined `+`, `–`, and `~` unary operators. Unary numeric promotion simply consists of converting operands of type `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, or `char` to type `int`. Additionally, for the unary `–` operator, unary numeric promotion converts operands of type `uint` to type `long`.

**End of informative text.**

#### Binary numeric promotions

**This subclause is informative.**

Binary numeric promotion occurs for the operands of the predefined `+`, `–`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` binary operators. Binary numeric promotion implicitly converts both operands to a common type which, in case of the non-relational operators, also becomes the result type of the operation. Binary numeric promotion consists of applying the following rules, in the order they appear here:

- If either operand is of type `decimal`, the other operand is converted to type `decimal`, or a binding-time error occurs if the other operand is of type `float` or `double`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is of type `double`, the other operand is converted to type `double`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is of type `float`, the other operand is converted to type `float`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is of type `ulong`, the other operand is converted to type `ulong`, or a binding-time error occurs if the other operand is of type `sbyte`, `short`, `int`, or `long`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is of type `long`, the other operand is converted to type `long`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is of type `uint` and the other operand is of type `sbyte`, `short`, or `int`, both operands are converted to type `long`.
- Otherwise, if either operand is of type `uint`, the other operand is converted to type `uint`.
- Otherwise, both operands are converted to type `int`.

> [!NOTE]
> The first rule disallows any operations that mix the `decimal` type with the `double` and `float` types. The rule follows from the fact that there are no implicit conversions between the `decimal` type and the `double` and `float` types.

> [!NOTE]
> Also note that it is not possible for an operand to be of type `ulong` when the other operand is of a signed integral type. The reason is that no integral type exists that can represent the full range of `ulong` as well as the signed integral types.

In both of the above cases, a cast expression can be used to explicitly convert one operand to a type that is compatible with the other operand.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
decimal AddPercent (decimal x, double percent)
{
    return x * (1.0 + percent / 100.0);
}
```

a binding-time error occurs because a decimal cannot be multiplied by a double. The error is resolved by explicitly converting the second operand to decimal, as follows:

```csharp
decimal AddPercent (decimal x, double percent)
{
    return x * (decimal) (1.0 + percent / 100.0);
}
```
*end example*]

**End of informative text.**

### Lifted operators

***Lifted operators*** permit predefined and user-defined operators that operate on non-nullable value types to also be used with nullable forms of those types. Lifted operators are constructed from predefined and user-defined operators that meet certain requirements, as described in the following:

- For the unary operators
  `+` `++` `-` `--` `!` `~`
  a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand and result types are both non-nullable value types. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single `?` modifier to the operand and result types. The lifted operator produces a null value if the operand is `null`. Otherwise, the lifted operator unwraps the operand, applies the underlying operator, and wraps the result.
- For the binary operators
  `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `&` `|` `^` `<<` `>>`
  a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand and result types are all non-nullable value types. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single `?` modifier to each operand and result type. The lifted operator produces a null value if one or both operands are null (an exception being the `&` and `|` operators of the `bool?` type, as described in §12.12.5). Otherwise, the lifted operator unwraps the operands, applies the underlying operator, and wraps the result.
- For the equality operators
  `==` `!=`
  a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand types are both non-nullable value types and if the result type is `bool`. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single `?` modifier to each operand type. The lifted operator considers two null values equal, and a null value unequal to any non-null value. If both operands are non-null, the lifted operator unwraps the operands and applies the underlying operator to produce the `bool` result.
- For the relational operators
  `<` `>` `<=` `>=`
  a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand types are both non-nullable value types and if the result type is `bool`. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single `?` modifier to each operand type. The lifted operator produces the value `false` if one or both operands are `null`. Otherwise, the lifted operator unwraps the operands and applies the underlying operator to produce the `bool` result.

## Member lookup

### General

A member lookup is the process whereby the meaning of a name in the context of a type is determined. A member lookup can occur as part of evaluating a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) or a *member-access* (§12.7.5) in an expression. If the *simple-name* or *member-access* occurs as the *primary-expression* of an *invocation-expression* (§12.7.6.2), the member is said to be *invoked*.

If a member is a method or event, or if it is a constant, field or property of either a delegate type (§20) or the type `dynamic` (§9.2.4), then the member is said to be *invocable.*

Member lookup considers not only the name of a member but also the number of type parameters the member has and whether the member is accessible. For the purposes of member lookup, generic methods and nested generic types have the number of type parameters indicated in their respective declarations and all other members have zero type parameters.

A member lookup of a name `N` with `K` type arguments in a type `T` is processed as follows:

- First, a set of accessible members named `N` is determined:
  - If `T` is a type parameter, then the set is the union of the sets of accessible members named `N` in each of the types specified as a primary constraint or secondary constraint (§15.2.5) for `T`, along with the set of accessible members named `N` in object.
  - Otherwise, the set consists of all accessible (§8.5) members named `N` in `T`, including inherited members and the accessible members named `N` in object. If `T` is a constructed type, the set of members is obtained by substituting type arguments as described in §15.3.3. Members that include an override modifier are excluded from the set.
- Next, if `K` is zero, all nested types whose declarations include type parameters are removed. If `K` is not zero, all members with a different number of type parameters are removed. When `K` is zero, methods having type parameters are not removed, since the type inference process (§12.6.3) might be able to infer the type arguments.
- Next, if the member is invoked, all non-invocable members are removed from the set.
- Next, members that are hidden by other members are removed from the set. For every member `S.M` in the set, where `S` is the type in which the member `M` is declared, the following rules are applied:
  - If `M` is a constant, field, property, event, or enumeration member, then all members declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.
  - If `M` is a type declaration, then all non-types declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set, and all type declarations with the same number of type parameters as `M` declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.
  - If `M` is a method, then all non-method members declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.
- Next, interface members that are hidden by class members are removed from the set. This step only has an effect if `T` is a type parameter and `T` has both an effective base class other than object and a non-empty effective interface set (§15.2.5). For every member `S.M` in the set, where `S` is the type in which the member `M` is declared, the following rules are applied if `S` is a class declaration other than object:
  - If `M` is a constant, field, property, event, enumeration member, or type declaration, then all members declared in an interface declaration are removed from the set.
  - If `M` is a method, then all non-method members declared in an interface declaration are removed from the set, and all methods with the same signature as `M` declared in an interface declaration are removed from the set.
- Finally, having removed hidden members, the result of the lookup is determined:
  - If the set consists of a single member that is not a method, then this member is the result of the lookup.
  - Otherwise, if the set contains only methods, then this group of methods is the result of the lookup.
  - Otherwise, the lookup is ambiguous, and a binding-time error occurs.

For member lookups in types other than type parameters and interfaces, and member lookups in interfaces that are strictly single-inheritance (each interface in the inheritance chain has exactly zero or one direct base interface), the effect of the lookup rules is simply that derived members hide base members with the same name or signature. Such single-inheritance lookups are never ambiguous. The ambiguities that can possibly arise from member lookups in multiple-inheritance interfaces are described in §18.4.6. 

> [!NOTE]
> This phase only accounts for one kind of ambiguity. If the member lookup results in a method group, further uses of method group may fail due to ambiguity, for example as described in §12.6.4.1 and §12.6.6.2.

### Base types

For purposes of member lookup, a type `T` is considered to have the following base types:

- If `T` is object or dynamic, then `T` has no base type.
- If `T` is an *enum-type*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.Enum`, `System.ValueType`, and `object`.
- If `T` is a *struct-type*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.ValueType` and `object`. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > A *nullable-value-type* is a *struct-type* (§9.3.1).
- If `T` is a *class-type*, the base types of `T` are the base classes of `T`, including the class type `object`.
- If `T` is an *interface-type*, the base types of `T` are the base interfaces of `T` and the class type `object`.
- If `T` is an *array-type*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.Array` and `object`.
- If `T` is a *delegate-type*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.Delegate` and `object`.

## Function members

### General

Function members are members that contain executable statements. Function members are always members of types and cannot be members of namespaces. C# defines the following categories of function members:

- Methods
- Properties
- Events
- Indexers
- User-defined operators
- Instance constructors
- Static constructors
- Finalizers

Except for finalizers and static constructors (which cannot be invoked explicitly), the statements contained in function members are executed through function member invocations. The actual syntax for writing a function member invocation depends on the particular function member category.

The argument list (§12.6.2) of a function member invocation provides actual values or variable references for the parameters of the function member.

Invocations of generic methods may employ type inference to determine the set of type arguments to pass to the method. This process is described in §12.6.3.

Invocations of methods, indexers, operators, and instance constructors employ overload resolution to determine which of a candidate set of function members to invoke. This process is described in §12.6.4.

Once a particular function member has been identified at binding-time, possibly through overload resolution, the actual run-time process of invoking the function member is described in §12.6.6.

> [!NOTE]
> The following table summarizes the processing that takes place in constructs involving the six categories of function members that can be explicitly invoked. In the table, e, x, y, and value indicate expressions classified as variables or values, T indicates an expression classified as a type, F is the simple name of a method, and P is the simple name of a property.

### Argument lists

#### General

Every function member and delegate invocation includes an argument list, which provides actual values or variable references for the parameters of the function member. The syntax for specifying the argument list of a function member invocation depends on the function member category:

- For instance constructors, methods, indexers and delegates, the arguments are specified as an *argument-list*, as described below. For indexers, when invoking the set accessor, the argument list additionally includes the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > This additional argument is not used for overload resolution, just during invocation of the set accessor.
- For properties, the argument list is empty when invoking the get accessor, and consists of the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator when invoking the set accessor.
- For events, the argument list consists of the expression specified as the right operand of the `+=` or `-=` operator.
- For user-defined operators, the argument list consists of the single operand of the unary operator or the two operands of the binary operator.

The arguments of properties (§15.7), events (§15.8), and user-defined operators (§15.10) are always passed as value parameters (§15.6.2.2). The arguments of indexers (§15.9) are always passed as value parameters (§15.6.2.2) or parameter arrays (§15.6.2.5). Reference and output parameters are not supported for these categories of function members.

The arguments of an instance constructor, method, indexer, or delegate invocation are specified as an *argument-list*:

```antlr
argument-list:
    argument
    argument-list , argument

argument:
    argument-nameopt argument-value

argument-name:
    identifier :

argument-value:
    expression
    ref variable-reference
    out variable-reference
```

An *argument-list* consists of one or more *argument*s, separated by commas. Each argument consists of an optional *argument-name* followed by an *argument-value*. An *argument* with an *argument-name* is referred to as a ***named argument***, whereas an *argument* without an *argument-name* is a ***positional argument***. It is an error for a positional argument to appear after a named argument in an *argument-list*.

The *argument-value* can take one of the following forms:

- An *expression*, indicating that the argument is passed as a value parameter (§15.6.2.2).
- The keyword `ref` followed by a *variable-reference* (§10.5), indicating that the argument is passed as a reference parameter (§15.6.2.3). A variable shall be definitely assigned (§10.4) before it can be passed as a reference parameter.
- The keyword `out` followed by a *variable-reference* (§10.5), indicating that the argument is passed as an output parameter (§15.6.2.4). A variable is considered definitely assigned (§10.4) following a function member invocation in which the variable is passed as an output parameter.

The form determines the ***parameter-passing mode*** of the argument: *value*, *reference*, or *output*, respectively.

Passing a volatile field (§15.5.4) as a reference parameter or output parameter causes a warning, since the field may not be treated as volatile by the invoked method.

#### Corresponding parameters

For each argument in an argument list there has to be a corresponding parameter in the function member or delegate being invoked.

The parameter list used in the following is determined as follows:

- For virtual methods and indexers defined in classes, the parameter list is picked from the first declaration or override of the function member found when starting with the static type of the receiver, and searching through its base classes.
- For partial methods, the parameter list of the defining partial method declaration is used.
- For all other function members and delegates there is only a single parameter list, which is the one used.

The position of an argument or parameter is defined as the number of arguments or parameters preceding it in the argument list or parameter list.

The corresponding parameters for function member arguments are established as follows:

- Arguments in the *argument-list* of instance constructors, methods, indexers and delegates:
  - A positional argument where a parameter occurs at the same position in the parameter list corresponds to that parameter, unless the parameter is a parameter array and the function member is invoked in its expanded form.
  - A positional argument of a function member with a parameter array invoked in its expanded form, which occurs at or after the position of the parameter array in the parameter list, corresponds to an element in the parameter array.
  - A named argument corresponds to the parameter of the same name in the parameter list.
  - For indexers, when invoking the set accessor, the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator corresponds to the implicit value parameter of the set accessor declaration.
- For properties, when invoking the get accessor there are no arguments. When invoking the set accessor, the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator corresponds to the implicit value parameter of the set accessor declaration.
- For user-defined unary operators (including conversions), the single operand corresponds to the single parameter of the operator declaration.
- For user-defined binary operators, the left operand corresponds to the first parameter, and the right operand corresponds to the second parameter of the operator declaration.

#### Run-time evaluation of argument lists

During the run-time processing of a function member invocation (§12.6.6), the expressions or variable references of an argument list are evaluated in order, from left to right, as follows:

- For a value parameter, the argument expression is evaluated and an implicit conversion (§11.2) to the corresponding parameter type is performed. The resulting value becomes the initial value of the value parameter in the function member invocation.
- For a reference or output parameter, the variable reference is evaluated and the resulting storage location becomes the storage location represented by the parameter in the function member invocation. If the variable reference given as a reference or output parameter is an array element of a *reference-type*, a run-time check is performed to ensure that the element type of the array is identical to the type of the parameter. If this check fails, a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` is thrown.

Methods, indexers, and instance constructors may declare their right-most parameter to be a parameter array (§15.6.2.5). Such function members are invoked either in their normal form or in their expanded form depending on which is applicable (§12.6.4.2):

- When a function member with a parameter array is invoked in its normal form, the argument given for the parameter array shall be a single expression that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the parameter array type. In this case, the parameter array acts precisely like a value parameter.
- When a function member with a parameter array is invoked in its expanded form, the invocation shall specify zero or more positional arguments for the parameter array, where each argument is an expression that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the element type of the parameter array. In this case, the invocation creates an instance of the parameter array type with a length corresponding to the number of arguments, initializes the elements of the array instance with the given argument values, and uses the newly created array instance as the actual argument.

The expressions of an argument list are always evaluated in textual order. [*Example*: Thus, the example

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void F (int x, int y = -1, int z = -2)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine ("x = {0}, y = {1}, z = {2}", x, y, z);
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 0;
        F (i++, i++, i++);
        F (z: i++, x: i++);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```csharp
x = 0, y = 1, z = 2
x = 4, y = -1, z = 3
```

*end example*]

The array co-variance rules (§17.6) permit a value of an array type `A[]` to be a reference to an instance of an array type `B[]`, provided an implicit reference conversion exists from `B` to `A`. Because of these rules, when an array element of a *reference-type* is passed as a reference or output parameter, a run-time check is required to ensure that the actual element type of the array is *identical* to that of the parameter. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void F (ref object x) {…}

    static void Main()
    {
        object[] a = new object[10];
        object[] b = new string[10];
        F (ref a[0]); // Ok
        F (ref b[1]); // ArrayTypeMismatchException
    }
}
```

the second invocation of `F` causes a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` to be thrown because the actual element type of `b` is `string` and not `object`. *end example*]

When a function member with a parameter array is invoked in its expanded form, the invocation is processed exactly as if an array creation expression with an array initializer (§12.7.11.5) was inserted around the expanded parameters. [*Example*: Given the declaration

```csharp
void F(int x, int y, params object[] args);
```

the following invocations of the expanded form of the method

```csharp
F(10, 20);
F(10, 20, 30, 40);
F(10, 20, 1, "hello", 3.0);
```

correspond exactly to

```csharp
F(10, 20, new object[] {});
F(10, 20, new object[] {30, 40});
F(10, 20, new object[] {1, "hello", 3.0});
```

In particular, note that an empty array is created when there are zero arguments given for the parameter array. *end example*]

When arguments are omitted from a function member with corresponding optional parameters, the default arguments of the function member declaration are implicitly passed. 

> [!NOTE]
> Because these are always constant, their evaluation will not impact the evaluation of the remaining arguments.

### Type inference

#### General

When a generic method is called without specifying type arguments, a ***type inference*** process attempts to infer type arguments for the call. The presence of type inference allows a more convenient syntax to be used for calling a generic method, and allows the programmer to avoid specifying redundant type information. [*Example*: Given the method declaration:

```csharp
class Chooser
{
    static Random rand = new Random ();

    public static T Choose<T> (T first, T second)
    {
        return (rand.Next (2) == 0) ? first : second;
    }
}
```

it is possible to invoke the `Choose` method without explicitly specifying a type argument:

```csharp
int i = Chooser.Choose(5, 213); // Calls Choose<int>

string s = Chooser.Choose("foo", "bar"); // Calls Choose<string>
```

Through type inference, the type arguments `int` and `string` are determined from the arguments to the method. *end example*]

Type inference occurs as part of the binding-time processing of a method invocation (§12.7.6.2) and takes place before the overload resolution step of the invocation. When a particular method group is specified in a method invocation, and no type arguments are specified as part of the method invocation, type inference is applied to each generic method in the method group. If type inference succeeds, then the inferred type arguments are used to determine the types of arguments for subsequent overload resolution. If overload resolution chooses a generic method as the one to invoke, then the inferred type arguments are used as the type arguments for the invocation. If type inference for a particular method fails, that method does not participate in overload resolution. The failure of type inference, in and of itself, does not cause a binding-time error. However, it often leads to a binding-time error when overload resolution then fails to find any applicable methods.

If each supplied argument does not correspond to exactly one parameter in the method (§12.6.2.2), or there is a non-optional parameter with no corresponding argument, then inference immediately fails. Otherwise, assume that the generic method has the following signature:

```csharp
Tr M<X1…Xn>(T1 p1 … Tm pm)
```

With a method call of the form `M(E1 …Em)` the task of type inference is to find unique type arguments `S1…Sn` for each of the type parameters `X1…Xn` so that the call `M<S1…Sn>(E1…Em)` becomes valid.

The process of type inference is described below as an algorithm. A conformant compiler may be implemented using an alternative approach, provided it reaches the same result in all cases.

During the process of inference each type parameter Xi is either *fixed* to a particular type `Si` or *unfixed* with an associated set of *bounds.* Each of the bounds is some type `T`. Initially each type variable `Xi` is unfixed with an empty set of bounds.

Type inference takes place in phases. Each phase will try to infer type arguments for more type variables based on the findings of the previous phase. The first phase makes some initial inferences of bounds, whereas the second phase fixes type variables to specific types and infers further bounds. The second phase may have to be repeated a number of times.

> [!NOTE]
> Type inference takes place not only when a generic method is called. Type inference for conversion of method groups is described in §12.6.3.14 and finding the best common type of a set of expressions is described in §12.6.3.15. 

#### The first phase

For each of the method arguments `Ei`:

- If `Ei` is an anonymous function, an *explicit parameter type inference* (§12.6.3.8) is made *from* `Ei` *to* `Ti`
- Otherwise, if `Ei` has a type `U` and `xi` is a value parameter (§15.6.2.2) then a *lower-bound inference* (§12.6.3.10) is made *from* `U` *to* `Ti`.
- Otherwise, if `Ei` has a type `U` and `xi` is a reference (§15.6.2.3) or output (§15.6.2.4) parameter then an *exact inference* (§12.6.3.9) is made *from* `U` *to* `Ti`.
- Otherwise, no inference is made for this argument.

#### The second phase

The second phase proceeds as follows:

- All *unfixed* type variables `Xi` which do not *depend on* (§12.6.3.6) any `Xj` are fixed (§12.6.3.12).
- If no such type variables exist, all *unfixed* type variables `Xi` are *fixed* for which all of the following hold:
    - There is at least one type variable `Xj` that *depends on* `Xi`
    - `Xi` has a non-empty set of bounds
- If no such type variables exist and there are still *unfixed* type variables, type inference fails.
- Otherwise, if no further *unfixed* type variables exist, type inference succeeds.
- Otherwise, for all arguments Ei with corresponding parameter type `Ti` where the *output types* (§12.6.3.5) contain *unfixed* type variables `Xj` but the *input types* (§12.6.3.4) do not, an *output type inference* (§12.6.3.7) is made *from* `Ei` *to* `Ti`. Then the second phase is repeated.

#### Input types

If `E` is a method group or implicitly typed anonymous function and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type then all the parameter types of `T` are *input types* *of* `E` *with type* `T`.

####  Output types

If `E` is a method group or an anonymous function and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type then the return type of `T` is an *output type* *of* `E` *with type* `T`.

#### Dependence

An *unfixed* type variable `Xi` *depends directly on* an *unfixed* type variable `Xj` if for some argument `Ek` with type `Tk Xj` occurs in an *input type* of `Ek` with type `Tk` and `Xi` occurs in an *output type* of `Ek` with type `Tk`.

`Xj` *depends on* `Xi` if `Xj` *depends directly on* `Xi` or if `Xi` *depends directly on* `Xk` and `Xk` *depends on* `Xj`. Thus “*depends on*” is the transitive but not reflexive closure of “*depends directly on*”.

#### Output type inferences

An *output type inference* is made *from* an expression `E` *to* a type `T` in the following way:

- If `E is an anonymous function with inferred return type `U` (§12.6.3.13) and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type with return type `Tb`, then a *lower-bound inference* (§12.6.3.10) is made *from*` `U` *to* `Tb`.
- Otherwise, if `E` is a method group and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type with parameter types `T1…Tk` and return type `Tb`, and overload resolution of `E` with the types `T1…Tk` yields a single method with return type `U`, then a *lower-bound inference* is made *from* `U` *to* `Tb`.
- Otherwise, if `E` is an expression with type `U`, then a *lower-bound inference* is made *from* `U` *to* `T`.
- Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Explicit parameter type inferences

An *explicit parameter type inference* is made *from* an expression `E` *to* a type `T` in the following way:

- If `E` is an explicitly typed anonymous function with parameter types `U1…Uk` and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type with parameter types `V1…Vk` then for each `Ui` an *exact inference* (§12.6.3.9) is made *from* `Ui` *to* the corresponding `Vi`.

#### Exact inferences

An *exact inference* *from* a type `U` *to* a type `V` is made as follows:

- If `V` is one of the *unfixed* `Xi` then `U` is added to the set of exact bounds for `Xi`.
- Otherwise, sets `V1…Vk` and `U1…Uk` are determined by checking if any of the following cases apply:
  - `V` is an array type `V1[…]` and `U` is an array type `U1[…]` of the same rank
  - `V` is the type `V1?` and `U` is the type `U1?`
  - `V` is a constructed type `C<V1…Vk>` and `U` is a constructed type `C<U1…Uk>`
    If any of these cases apply then an *exact inference* is made from each `Ui` to the corresponding `Vi`.
- Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Lower-bound inferences

A *lower-bound inference from* a type `U` *to* a type `V` is made as follows:

- If `V` is one of the *unfixed* `Xi` then `U` is added to the set of lower bounds for `Xi`.
- Otherwise, if `V` is the type `V1?` and `U` is the type `U1?` then a lower bound inference is made from `U1` to `V1`.
- Otherwise, sets `U1…Uk` and `V1…Vk` are determined by checking if any of the following cases apply:
  - `V` is an array type `V1[…]` and `U` is an array type `U1[…]` of the same rank
  - `V` is one of `IEnumerable<V1>`, `ICollection<V1>`, `IReadOnlyList<V1>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<V1>` or `IList<V1>` and `U` is a single-dimensional array type `U1[]`
  - `V` is a constructed class, struct, interface or delegate type `C<V1…Vk>` and there is a unique type `C<U1…Uk>` such that `U` (or, if `U` is a type parameter, its effective base class or any member of its effective interface set) is identical to, inherits from (directly or indirectly), or implements (directly or indirectly) `C<U1…Uk>`.
  - (The “uniqueness” restriction means that in the case interface `C<T>{}` class `U`: `C<X>`, `C<Y>{}`, then no inference is made when inferring from `U` to `C<T>` because `U1` could be `X` or `Y`.)\
    If any of these cases apply then an inference is made from each `Ui` to the corresponding `Vi` as follows:
  - If `Ui` is not known to be a reference type then an *exact inference* is made
  - Otherwise, if `U` is an array type then a *lower-bound inference* is made
  - Otherwise, if `V` is `C<V1…Vk>` then inference depends on the i-th type parameter of `C`:
    - If it is covariant then a *lower-bound inference* is made.
    - If it is contravariant then an *upper-bound inference* is made.
    - If it is invariant then an *exact inference* is made.
- Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Upper-bound inferences

An *upper-bound inference from* a type `U` *to* a type `V` is made as follows:

- If `V` is one of the *unfixed* `Xi` then `U` is added to the set of upper bounds for `Xi`.
- Otherwise, sets `V1…Vk` and `U1…Uk` are determined by checking if any of the following cases apply:
  - `U` is an array type `U1[…]` and `V` is an array type `V1[…]` of the same rank
  - `U` is one of `IEnumerable<Ue>`, `ICollection<Ue>`, `IReadOnlyList<Ue>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<Ue>` or `IList<Ue>` and `V` is a single-dimensional array type `Ve[]`
  - `U` is the type `U1?` and `V` is the type `V1?`
  - `U` is constructed class, struct, interface or delegate type `C<U1…Uk>` and `V` is a class, struct, interface or delegate type which is identical to, inherits from (directly or indirectly), or implements (directly or indirectly) a unique type `C<V1…Vk>`
  - (The “uniqueness” restriction means that if we have interface `C<T>{} class V<Z>: C<X<Z>>, C<Y<Z>>{}`, then no inference is made when inferring from `C<U1>` to `V<Q>`. Inferences are not made from `U1 `to either `X<Q>` or `Y<Q>`.)\
  If any of these cases apply then an inference is made from each `Ui` to the corresponding `Vi` as follows:
  - If `Ui` is not known to be a reference type then an *exact inference* is made
  - Otherwise, if `V` is an array type then an *upper-bound inference* is made
  - Otherwise, if `U` is `C<U1…Uk>` then inference depends on the i-th type parameter of `C`:
    - If it is covariant then an *upper-bound inference* is made.
    - If it is contravariant then a *lower-bound inference* is made.
    - If it is invariant then an *exact inference* is made.
- Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Fixing

An *unfixed* type variable `Xi` with a set of bounds is *fixed* as follows:

- The set of *candidate types* `Uj` starts out as the set of all types in the set of bounds for `Xi`.
- We then examine each bound for `Xi` in turn: For each exact bound `U` of `Xi` all types `Uj` that are not identical to `U` are removed from the candidate set. For each lower bound `U` of `Xi` all types `Uj` to which there is *not* an implicit conversion from `U` are removed from the candidate set. For each upper-bound `U` of `Xi` all types `Uj` from which there is *not* an implicit conversion to `U` are removed from the candidate set.
- If among the remaining candidate types `Uj` there is a unique type `V` to which there is an implicit conversion from all the other candidate types, then `Xi` is fixed to `V`.
- Otherwise, type inference fails.

#### Inferred return type

The inferred return type of an anonymous function `F` is used during type inference and overload resolution. The inferred return type can only be determined for an anonymous function where all parameter types are known, either because they are explicitly given, provided through an anonymous function conversion or inferred during type inference on an enclosing generic method invocation.

The ***inferred effective return type*** is determined as follows:

- If the body of `F` is an *expression* that has a type, then the inferred effective return type of `F` is the type of that expression.
- If the body of `F` is a *block* and the set of expressions in the block’s return statements has a best common type `T` (§12.6.3.15), then the inferred effective return type of `F` is `T`.
- Otherwise, an effective return type cannot be inferred for `F`.

The ***inferred return type*** is determined as follows:

- If `F` is `async` and the body of `F` is either an expression classified as nothing (§12.2), or a statement block where no return statements have expressions, the inferred return type is `System.Threading.Tasks.Task`
- If `F` is `async` and has an inferred effective return type `T`, the inferred return type is `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<T>`.
- If `F` is non-async and has an inferred effective return type `T`, the inferred return type is `T`.
- Otherwise, a return type cannot be inferred for `F`.

[*Example*: As an example of type inference involving anonymous functions, consider the Select extension method declared in the System.Linq.Enumerable class:

```csharp
namespace System.Linq
{
    public static class Enumerable
    {
        public static IEnumerable<TResult> Select<TSource, TResult> (
            this IEnumerable<TSource> source,
            Func<TSource, TResult> selector)
        {
            foreach (TSource element in source) yield return selector (element);
        }
    }
}
```

Assuming the `System.Linq` namespace was imported with a using namespace directive, and given a class `Customer` with a `Name` property of type `string`, the `Select` method can be used to select the names of a list of customers:

```csharp
List<Customer> customers = GetCustomerList();
IEnumerable<string> names = customers.Select(c => c.Name);
```

The extension method invocation (§12.7.6.3) of `Select` is processed by rewriting the invocation to a static method invocation:

```csharp
IEnumerable<string> names = Enumerable.Select(customers, c => c.Name);
```

Since type arguments were not explicitly specified, type inference is used to infer the type arguments. First, the customers argument is related to the source parameter, inferring `TSource` to be `Customer`. Then, using the anonymous function type inference process described above, `c` is given type `Customer`, and the expression `c.Name` is related to the return type of the selector parameter, inferring `TResult` to be `string`. Thus, the invocation is equivalent to

```csharp
Sequence.Select<Customer,string>(customers, (Customer c) => c.Name)
```

and the result is of type `IEnumerable<string>`.

The following example demonstrates how anonymous function type inference allows type information to “flow” between arguments in a generic method invocation. Given the method:

```csharp
static Z F<X, Y, Z> (X value, Func<X, Y> f1, Func<Y, Z> f2)
{
    return f2 (f1 (value));
}
```

Type inference for the invocation:

```csharp
double seconds = F("1:15:30", s => TimeSpan.Parse(s), t => t.TotalSeconds);
```

proceeds as follows: First, the argument `"1:15:30"` is related to the value parameter, inferring `X` to be `string`. Then, the parameter of the first anonymous function, `s`, is given the inferred type `string`, and the expression `TimeSpan.Parse(s)` is related to the return type of `f1`, inferring `Y` to be `System.TimeSpan`. Finally, the parameter of the second anonymous function, `t`, is given the inferred type `System.TimeSpan`, and the expression `t.TotalSeconds` is related to the return type of `f2`, inferring `Z` to be `double`. Thus, the result of the invocation is of type `double`. *end example*]

#### Type inference for conversion of method groups

Similar to calls of generic methods, type inference shall also be applied when a method group `M` containing a generic method is converted to a given delegate type `D` (§11.8). Given a method

```csharp
Tr M<X1…Xn>(T1 x1 … Tm xm)
```

and the method group `M` being assigned to the delegate type `D` the task of type inference is to find type arguments S1…Sn so that the expression:

```csharp
M<S1…Sn>
```

becomes compatible (§20.2) with `D`.

Unlike the type inference algorithm for generic method calls, in this case, there are only argument *types*, no argument *expressions*. In particular, there are no anonymous functions and hence no need for multiple phases of inference.

Instead, all `Xi` are considered *unfixed*, and a *lower-bound inference* is made *from* each argument type `Uj` of `D `*to* the corresponding parameter type `Tj` of `M`. If for any of the `Xi` no bounds were found, type inference fails. Otherwise, all `Xi` are *fixed* to corresponding `Si`, which are the result of type inference.

#### Finding the best common type of a set of expressions

In some cases, a common type needs to be inferred for a set of expressions. In particular, the element types of implicitly typed arrays and the return types of anonymous functions with *block* bodies are found in this way.

The best common type for a set of expressions `E1…Em` is determined as follows:

- A new *unfixed* type variable `X` is introduced.
- For each expression `Ei` an *output type inference* (§12.6.3.7) is performed from it to `X`.
- `X` is *fixed* (§12.6.3.12), if possible, and the resulting type is the best common type.
- Otherwise inference fails.

Intuitively this inference is equivalent to calling a method

```csharp
void M<X>(X x1 … X xm)
```

with the `Ei` as arguments and inferring `X`. 

### Overload resolution

#### General

Overload resolution is a binding-time mechanism for selecting the best function member to invoke given an argument list and a set of candidate function members. Overload resolution selects the function member to invoke in the following distinct contexts within C#:

- Invocation of a method named in an *invocation-expression* (§12.7.6).
- Invocation of an instance constructor named in an *object-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.2).
- Invocation of an indexer accessor through an *element-access* (§12.7.7).
- Invocation of a predefined or user-defined operator referenced in an expression (§12.4.4 and §12.4.5).

Each of these contexts defines the set of candidate function members and the list of arguments in its own unique way. For instance, the set of candidates for a method invocation does not include methods marked override (§12.5), and methods in a base class are not candidates if any method in a derived class is applicable (§12.7.6.2).

Once the candidate function members and the argument list have been identified, the selection of the best function member is the same in all cases:

- First, the set of candidate function members is reduced to those function members that are applicable with respect to the given argument list (§12.6.4.2). If this reduced set is empty, a compile-time error occurs.
- Then, the best function member from the set of applicable candidate function members is located. If the set contains only one function member, then that function member is the best function member. Otherwise, the best function member is the one function member that is better than all other function members with respect to the given argument list, provided that each function member is compared to all other function members using the rules in §12.6.4.3. If there is not exactly one function member that is better than all other function members, then the function member invocation is ambiguous and a binding-time error occurs.

The following subclauses define the exact meanings of the terms ***applicable function member*** and ***better function member***.

#### Applicable function member

A function member is said to be an ***applicable function member*** with respect to an argument list `A` when all of the following are true:

- Each argument in `A` corresponds to a parameter in the function member declaration as described in §12.6.2.2, at most one argument corresponds to each parameter, and any parameter to which no argument corresponds is an optional parameter.
- For each argument in `A`, the parameter-passing mode of the argument is identical to the parameter-passing mode of the corresponding parameter, and
  - for a value parameter or a parameter array, an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from the argument expression to the type of the corresponding parameter, or
  - for a `ref` or `out` parameter, there is an identity conversion between the type of the argument expression and the type of the corresponding parameter\
  For a function member that includes a parameter array, if the function member is applicable by the above rules, it is said to be applicable in its ***normal form***. If a function member that includes a parameter array is not applicable in its normal form, the function member might instead be applicable in its ***expanded form***:
  - The expanded form is constructed by replacing the parameter array in the function member declaration with zero or more value parameters of the element type of the parameter array such that the number of arguments in the argument list `A` matches the total number of parameters. If `A` has fewer arguments than the number of fixed parameters in the function member declaration, the expanded form of the function member cannot be constructed and is thus not applicable.
  - Otherwise, the expanded form is applicable if for each argument in `A` the parameter-passing mode of the argument is identical to the parameter-passing mode of the corresponding parameter, and
- for a fixed value parameter or a value parameter created by the expansion, an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from the argument expression to the type of the corresponding parameter, or
- for a `ref` or `out` parameter, the type of the argument expression is identical to the type of the corresponding parameter.

#### Better function member

For the purposes of determining the better function member, a stripped-down argument list `A` is constructed containing just the argument expressions themselves in the order they appear in the original argument list.

Parameter lists for each of the candidate function members are constructed in the following way:

- The expanded form is used if the function member was applicable only in the expanded form.
- Optional parameters with no corresponding arguments are removed from the parameter list
- The parameters are reordered so that they occur at the same position as the corresponding argument in the argument list.

Given an argument list `A` with a set of argument expressions `{ E1, E2, …, EN }` and two applicable function members `MP` and `MQ` with parameter types `{ P1, P2, …, PN }` and `{ Q1, Q2, …, QN }`, `MP` is defined to be a ***better function member*** than `MQ` if

- for each argument, the implicit conversion from `EX` to `QX` is not better than the implicit conversion from `EX` to `PX`, and
- for at least one argument, the conversion from `EX` to `PX `is better than the conversion from `EX` to `QX`.

In case the parameter type sequences `{P1, P2, …, PN}` and `{Q1, Q2, …, QN}` are equivalent (i.e., each `Pi` has an identity conversion to the corresponding `Qi`), the following tie-breaking rules are applied, in order, to determine the better function member.

- If `MP` is a non-generic method and `MQ` is a generic method, then `MP` is better than `MQ`.
- Otherwise, if `MP` is applicable in its normal form and `MQ` has a params array and is applicable only in its expanded form, then `MP` is better than `MQ`.
- Otherwise, if both methods have params arrays and are applicable only in their expanded forms, and if the params array of `MP` has fewer elements than the params array of `MQ`, then `MP` is better than `MQ`.
- Otherwise, if `MP` has more specific parameter types than MQ, then MP is better than `MQ`. Let `{R1, R2, …, RN}` and `{S1, S2, …, SN}` represent the uninstantiated and unexpanded parameter types of `MP` and `MQ`. `MP`’s parameter types are more specific than `MQ`’s if, for each parameter, `RX` is not less specific than `SX`, and, for at least one parameter, `RX` is more specific than `SX`:
  - A type parameter is less specific than a non-type parameter.
  - Recursively, a constructed type is more specific than another constructed type (with the same number of type arguments) if at least one type argument is more specific and no type argument is less specific than the corresponding type argument in the other.
  - An array type is more specific than another array type (with the same number of dimensions) if the element type of the first is more specific than the element type of the second.
- Otherwise if one member is a non-lifted operator and the other is a lifted operator, the non-lifted one is better.
- If neither function member was found to be better, and all parameters of MP have a corresponding argument whereas default arguments need to be substituted for at least one optional parameter in `MQ`, then `MP` is better than `MQ`. Otherwise, no function member is better.

#### Better conversion from expression

Given an implicit conversion `C1` that converts from an expression `E` to a type `T1`, and an implicit conversion `C2` that converts from an expression `E` to a type `T2`, `C1` is a ***better conversion*** than `C2` if at least one of the following holds:

- `E` has a type `S` and an identity conversion exists from `S` to `T1` but not from `S` to `T2`
- `E` is not an anonymous function and `T1` is a better conversion target than `T2` (§12.6.4.6)
- `E` is an anonymous function, `T1` is either a delegate type `D1` or an expression tree type `Expression<D1>`, `T2` is either a delegate type `D2` or an expression tree type `Expression<D2>` and one of the following holds:
  - `D1` is a better conversion target than `D2`
  - `D1` and `D2` have identical parameter lists, and one of the following holds:
    - `D1` has a return type `Y1`, and `D2` has a return type `Y2`, an inferred return type `X` exists for `E` in the context of that parameter list (§12.6.3.13), and the conversion from `X` to `Y1 `is better than the conversion from `X` to `Y2`
    - `E` is async, `D1` has a return type `Task<Y1>`, and `D2` has a return type `Task<Y2>`, an inferred return type `Task<X>` exists for `E` in the context of that parameter list (§12.6.3.13), and the conversion from `X` to `Y1` is better than the conversion from `X` to `Y2`
    - `D1` has a return type `Y`, and `D2` is void returning

#### Better conversion from type

Given a conversion `C1` that converts from a type `S` to a type `T1`, and a conversion `C2` that converts from a type `S` to a type `T2`, `C1` is a ***better conversion*** than `C2` if at least one of the following holds:

- An identity conversion exists from `S` to `T1` but not from `S` to `T2`
- `T1` is a better conversion target than `T2` (§12.6.4.6)

#### Better conversion target

Given two different types `T1` and `T2`, `T1` is a better conversion target than `T2` if at least one of the following holds:

- An implicit conversion from `T1` to `T2` exists, and no implicit conversion from `T2` to `T1` exists
- `T1` is a signed integral type and `T2` is an unsigned integral type. Specifically:
  - `T1` is `sbyte` and `T2` is `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, or `ulong`
  - `T1` is `short` and `T2` is `ushort`, `uint`, or `ulong`
  - `T1` is `int` and `T2` is `uint`, or `ulong`
  - `T1` is `long` and `T2` is `ulong`

#### Overloading in generic classes

> [!NOTE]
> While signatures as declared shall be unique (§9.6), it is possible that substitution of type arguments results in identical signatures. In such a situation, overload resolution will pick the most specific (§12.6.4.3) of the original signatures (before substitution of type arguments), if it exists, and otherwise report an error.

[*Example*: The following examples show overloads that are valid and invalid according to this rule:

```csharp
interface I1<T> {…}

interface I2<T> {…}

class G1<U>
{
    int F1 (U u); // Overload resolution for G<int>.F1
    int F1 (int i); // will pick non-generic

    void F2 (I1<U> a); // Valid overload
    void F2 (I2<U> a);
}

class G2<U, V>
{
    void F3 (U u, V v); // Valid, but overload resolution for
    void F3 (V v, U u); // G2<int,int>.F3 will fail

    void F4 (U u, I1<V> v); // Valid, but overload resolution for
    void F4 (I1<V> v, U u); // G2<I1<int>,int>.F4 will fail

    void F5 (U u1, I1<V> v2); // Valid overload
    void F5 (V v1, U u2);

    void F6 (ref U u); // valid overload
    void F6 (out V v);
}
```

*end example*]

### Compile-time checking of dynamic member invocation

Even though overload resolution of a dynamically bound operation takes place at run-time, it is sometimes possible at compile-time to know the list of function members from which an overload will be chosen:

- For a delegate invocation (§12.7.6.4), the list is a single function member with the same parameter list as the *delegate-type* of the invocation
- For a method invocation (§12.7.6.2) on a type, or on a value whose static type is not dynamic, the set of accessible methods in the method group is known at compile-time.
- For an object creation expression (§12.7.11.2) the set of accessible constructors in the type is known at compile-time.
- For an indexer access (§12.7.7.3) the set of accessible indexers in the receiver is known at compile-time.

In these cases a limited compile-time check is performed on each member in the known set of function members, to see if it can be known for certain never to be invoked at run-time. For each function member `F` a modified parameter and argument list are constructed:

- First, if `F` is a generic method and type arguments were provided, then those are substituted for the type parameters in the parameter list. However, if type arguments were not provided, no such substitution happens.
- Then, any parameter whose type is open (i.e., contains a type parameter; see §9.4.3) is elided, along with its corresponding parameter(s).\
  For `F` to pass the check, all of the following shall hold:
- The modified parameter list for `F` is applicable to the modified argument list in terms of §12.6.4.2.
- All constructed types in the modified parameter list satisfy their constraints (§9.4.5).
- If the type parameters of `F` were substituted in the step above, their constraints are satisfied.
- If `F` is a static method, the method group shall not have resulted from a *member-access* whose receiver is known at compile-time to be a variable or value.
- If `F` is an instance method, the method group shall not have resulted from a *member-access* whose receiver is known at compile-time to be a type.

If no candidate passes this test, a compile-time error occurs.

### Function member invocation

#### General

This subclause describes the process that takes place at run-time to invoke a particular function member. It is assumed that a binding-time process has already determined the particular member to invoke, possibly by applying overload resolution to a set of candidate function members.

For purposes of describing the invocation process, function members are divided into two categories:

- Static function members. These are static methods, static property accessors, and user-defined operators. Static function members are always non-virtual.
- Instance function members. These are instance methods, instance constructors, instance property accessors, and indexer accessors. Instance function members are either non-virtual or virtual, and are always invoked on a particular instance. The instance is computed by an instance expression, and it becomes accessible within the function member as this (§12.7.8). For an instance constructor, the instance expression is taken to be the newly allocated object.

The run-time processing of a function member invocation consists of the following steps, where `M` is the function member and, if `M` is an instance member, `E` is the instance expression:

- If `M` is a static function member:
  - The argument list is evaluated as described in §12.6.2.
  - `M` is invoked.
- Otherwise, if the type of `E` is a value-type `V`, and `M` is declared or overridden in `V`:
  - `E` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, then no further steps are executed. For an instance constructor, this evaluation consists of allocating storage (typically from an execution stack) for the new object. In this case `E` is classified as a variable.
  - If `E` is not classified as a variable, then a temporary local variable of `E`’s type is created and the value of `E` is assigned to that variable. `E` is then reclassified as a reference to that temporary local variable. The temporary variable is accessible as this within `M`, but not in any other way. Thus, only when `E` is a true variable is it possible for the caller to observe the changes that `M` makes to this.
  - The argument list is evaluated as described in §12.6.2.
  - `M` is invoked. The variable referenced by `E` becomes the variable referenced by this.
- Otherwise:
  - `E` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, then no further steps are executed.
  - The argument list is evaluated as described in §12.6.2.
  - If the type of `E` is a *value-type*, a boxing conversion (§11.2.8) is performed to convert `E` to a *class-type*, and `E` is considered to be of that *class-type* in the following steps. If the *value-type* is an *enum-type*, the *class-type* is `System.Enum`; otherwise, it is `System.ValueType`.
  - The value of `E` is checked to be valid. If the value of `E` is `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
  - The function member implementation to invoke is determined:
    - If the binding-time type of `E` is an interface, the function member to invoke is the implementation of `M` provided by the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`. This function member is determined by applying the interface mapping rules (§18.6.5) to determine the implementation of `M` provided by the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`.
    - Otherwise, if `M` is a virtual function member, the function member to invoke is the implementation of M provided by the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`. This function member is determined by applying the rules for determining the most derived implementation (§15.6.4) of `M` with respect to the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`.
    - Otherwise, `M` is a non-virtual function member, and the function member to invoke is `M` itself.
  - The function member implementation determined in the step above is invoked. The object referenced by `E` becomes the object referenced by this.

The result of the invocation of an instance constructor (§12.7.11.2) is the value created. The result of the invocation of any other function member is the value, if any, returned (§13.10.5) from its body.

#### Invocations on boxed instances

A function member implemented in a *value-type* can be invoked through a boxed instance of that *value-type* in the following situations:

- When the function member is an override of a method inherited from type *class-type* and is invoked through an instance expression of that *class-type*. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > The *class-type* will always be one of `System.Object`, `System.ValueType` or `System.Enum`.
- When the function member is an implementation of an interface function member and is invoked through an instance expression of an *interface-type*.
- When the function member is invoked through a delegate.

In these situations, the boxed instance is considered to contain a variable of the *value-type*, and this variable becomes the variable referenced by this within the function member invocation. 
> [!NOTE]
> In particular, this means that when a function member is invoked on a boxed instance, it is possible for the function member to modify the value contained in the boxed instance.

## Primary expressions

### General

Primary expressions include the simplest forms of expressions.

```antlr
primary-expression:
    primary-no-array-creation-expression
    array-creation-expression

primary-no-array-creation-expression:
    literal
    simple-name
    parenthesized-expression
    member-access
    invocation-expression
    element-access
    this-access
    base-access
    post-increment-expression
    post-decrement-expression
    object-creation-expression
    delegate-creation-expression
    anonymous-object-creation-expression
    typeof-expression
    sizeof-expression
    checked-expression
    unchecked-expression
    default-value-expression
    anonymous-method-expression
```

Primary expressions are divided between *array-creation-expression*s and *primary-no-array-creation-expression*s. Treating *array-creation-expression* in this way, rather than listing it along with the other simple expression forms, enables the grammar to disallow potentially confusing code such as

```csharp
object o = new int[3][1];
```

which would otherwise be interpreted as

```csharp
object o = (new int[3])[1];
```

### Literals

A *primary-expression* that consists of a *literal* (§7.4.5) is classified as a value.

### Simple names

#### General

A *simple-name* consists of an identifier, optionally followed by a type argument list:

```antlr
simple-name:
    identifier type-argument-listopt
```

A *simple-name* is either of the form `I` or of the form `I<A1, …, AK>`, where `I` is a single identifier and `<A1, …, AK>` is an optional *type-argument-list*. When no *type-argument-list* is specified, consider `K` to be zero. The *simple-name* is evaluated and classified as follows:

- If `K` is zero and the *simple-name* appears within a *block* and if the *block*’s (or an enclosing *block*’s) local variable declaration space (§8.3) contains a local variable, parameter or constant with name `I`, then the *simple-name* refers to that local variable, parameter or constant and is classified as a variable or value.
- If `K` is zero and the *simple-name* appears within a generic method declaration but outside the *attributes* of its *method-header,* and if that declaration includes a type parameter with name `I`, then the *simple-name* refers to that type parameter.
- Otherwise, for each instance type `T` (§15.3.2), starting with the instance type of the immediately enclosing type declaration and continuing with the instance type of each enclosing class or struct declaration (if any):
  - If `K` is zero and the declaration of `T` includes a type parameter with name `I`, then the *simple-name* refers to that type parameter.
  - Otherwise, if a member lookup (§12.5) of `I` in `T` with `K` type arguments produces a match:
    - If `T` is the instance type of the immediately enclosing class or struct type and the lookup identifies one or more methods, the result is a method group with an associated instance expression of this. If a type argument list was specified, it is used in calling a generic method (§12.7.6.2).
    - Otherwise, if `T` is the instance type of the immediately enclosing class or struct type, if the lookup identifies an instance member, and if the reference occurs within the *block* of an instance constructor, an instance method, or an instance accessor (§12.2.1), the result is the same as a member access (§12.7.5) of the form `this.I`. This can only happen when `K` is zero.
    - Otherwise, the result is the same as a member access (§12.7.5) of the form `T.I` or `T.I<A1, …, AK>`. In this case, it is a binding-time error for the *simple-name* to refer to an instance member.
- Otherwise, for each namespace `N`, starting with the namespace in which the *simple-name* occurs, continuing with each enclosing namespace (if any), and ending with the global namespace, the following steps are evaluated until an entity is located:
  - If `K` is zero and `I` is the name of a namespace in `N`, then:
    - If the location where the *simple-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N` and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with a namespace or type, then the *simple-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
    - Otherwise, the *simple-name* refers to the namespace named `I` in `N`.
  - Otherwise, if `N` contains an accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then:
    - If `K` is zero and the location where the *simple-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N` and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with a namespace or type, then the *simple-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
    - Otherwise, the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to the type constructed with the given type arguments.
  - Otherwise, if the location where the *simple-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N`:
    - If `K` is zero and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with an imported namespace or type, then the *simple-name* refers to that namespace or type.
    - Otherwise, if the namespaces imported by the *using-namespace-directive*s of the namespace declaration contain exactly one type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *simple-name* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments.
    - Otherwise, if the namespaces imported by the *using-namespace-directive*s of the namespace declaration contain more than one type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *simple-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.
  > [!NOTE]
  > This entire step is exactly parallel to the corresponding step in the processing of a *namespace-or-type-name* (§8.8).
- Otherwise, the *simple-name* is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.

#### Invariant meaning in blocks

For each occurrence of a given identifier as a full *simple-name* (without a type argument list) in an expression or declarator, within the local variable declaration space (§8.3) immediately enclosing that occurrence, every other occurrence of the same identifier as a full *simple-name* in an expression or declarator shall refer to the same entity. 

> [!NOTE]
> This rule ensures that the meaning of a name is always the same within a given block, switch block, for-, foreach- or using-statement, or anonymous function.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
class Test
{
    double x;

    void F (bool b)
    {
        x = 1.0;
        if (b)
        {
            int x;
            x = 1;
        }
    }
}
```
results in a compile-time error because x refers to different entities within the outer block (the extent of which includes the nested block in the `if` statement). In contrast, the example

```csharp
class Test
{
    double x;

    void F (bool b)
    {
        if (b)
        {
            x = 1.0;
        }
        else
        {
            int x;
            x = 1;
        }
    }
}
```

is permitted because the name `x` is never used in the outer block. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> The rule of invariant meaning applies only to simple names. It is perfectly valid for the same identifier to have one meaning as a simple name and another meaning as right operand of a member access (§12.7.5).

[*Example*:

```csharp
struct Point
{
    int x, y;

    public Point (int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

The example above illustrates a common pattern of using the names of fields as parameter names in an instance constructor. In the example, the simple names `x` and `y` refer to the parameters, but that does not prevent the member access expressions this.x and this.y from accessing the fields. *end example*]

### Parenthesized expressions

A *parenthesized-expression* consists of an *expression* enclosed in parentheses.

```antlr
parenthesized-expression:
    ( expression )
```

A *parenthesized-expression* is evaluated by evaluating the *expression* within the parentheses. If the *expression* within the parentheses denotes a namespace or type, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, the result of the *parenthesized-expression* is the result of the evaluation of the contained *expression*.

### Member access

#### General

A *member-access* consists of a *primary-expression*, a *predefined-type*, or a *qualified-alias-member*, followed by a “`.`” token, followed by an *identifier*, optionally followed by a *type-argument-list*.

```antlr
member-access:
    primary-expression . identifier type-argument-listopt
    predefined-type . identifier type-argument-listopt
    qualified-alias-member . identifier type-argument-listopt

predefined-type: one of
    bool byte char decimal double float int long
    object sbyte short string uint ulong ushort
```

The *qualified-alias-member* production is defined in §14.8.

A *member-access* is either of the form `E.I` or of the form `E.I<A1, …, AK>`, where `E` is a *primary-expression*, *predefined-type* or *qualified-alias-member,* `I` is a single identifier, and `<A1, …, AK>` is an optional *type-argument-list*. When no *type-argument-list* is specified, consider `K` to be zero.

A *member-access* with a *primary-expression* of type dynamic is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compiler classifies the member access as a property access of type dynamic. The rules below to determine the meaning of the *member-access* are then applied at run-time, using the run-time type instead of the compile-time type of the *primary-expression*. If this run-time classification leads to a method group, then the member access shall be the *primary-expression* of an *invocation-expression*.

The *member-access* is evaluated and classified as follows:

- If `K` is zero and `E` is a namespace and `E` contains a nested namespace with name `I`, then the result is that namespace.
- Otherwise, if `E` is a namespace and `E` contains an accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the result is that type constructed with the given type arguments.
- If `E` is classified as a type, if `E` is not a type parameter, and if a member lookup (§12.5) of `I` in `E` with `K` type parameters produces a match, then `E.I` is evaluated and classified as follows: 
  > [!NOTE]
  > When the result of such a member lookup is a method group and `K` is zero, the method group can contain methods having type parameters. This allows such methods to be considered for type argument inferencing.
  - If `I` identifies a type, then the result is that type constructed with any given type arguments.
  - If `I` identifies one or more methods, then the result is a method group with no associated instance expression.
  - If `I` identifies a static property, then the result is a property access with no associated instance expression.
  - If `I` identifies a static field:
    - If the field is readonly and the reference occurs outside the static constructor of the class or struct in which the field is declared, then the result is a value, namely the value of the static field `I` in `E`.
    - Otherwise, the result is a variable, namely the static field `I` in `E`.
  - If I identifies a static event:
    - If the reference occurs within the class or struct in which the event is declared, and the event was declared without *event-accessor-declarations* (§15.8.1), then `E.I` is processed exactly as if `I` were a static field.
    - Otherwise, the result is an event access with no associated instance expression.
  - If `I` identifies a constant, then the result is a value, namely the value of that constant.
  - If `I` identifies an enumeration member, then the result is a value, namely the value of that enumeration member.
  - Otherwise, E.I is an invalid member reference, and a compile-time error occurs.
- If `E` is a property access, indexer access, variable, or value, the type of which is `T`, and a member lookup (§12.5) of `I` in `T` with `K` type arguments produces a match, then `E.I` is evaluated and classified as follows:
  - First, if `E` is a property or indexer access, then the value of the property or indexer access is obtained (§12.2.2) and `E` is reclassified as a value.
  - If `I` identifies one or more methods, then the result is a method group with an associated instance expression of `E`.
  - If `I` identifies an instance property, then the result is a property access with an associated instance expression of `E` and an associated type that is the type of the property. If `T` is a class type, the associated type is picked from the first declaration or override of the property found when starting with `T`, and searching through its base classes.
  - If `T` is a *class-type* and `I` identifies an instance field of that *class-type*:
    - If the value of `E` is `null`, then a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown.
    - Otherwise, if the field is `readonly` and the reference occurs outside an instance constructor of the class in which the field is declared, then the result is a value, namely the value of the field `I` in the object referenced by `E`.
    - Otherwise, the result is a variable, namely the field `I` in the object referenced by `E`.
  - If `T` is a *struct-type* and `I` identifies an instance field of that *struct-type*:
    - If `E` is a value, or if the field is readonly and the reference occurs outside an instance constructor of the struct in which the field is declared, then the result is a value, namely the value of the field `I` in the struct instance given by `E`.
    - Otherwise, the result is a variable, namely the field `I` in the struct instance given by `E`.
  - If `I` identifies an instance event:
    - If the reference occurs within the class or struct in which the event is declared, and the event was declared without *event-accessor-declarations* (§15.8.1), and the reference does not occur as the left-hand side of a `+=` or `-=` operator, then `E.I` is processed exactly as if `I` was an instance field.
    - Otherwise, the result is an event access with an associated instance expression of `E`.
- Otherwise, an attempt is made to process `E.I` as an extension method invocation (§12.7.6.3). If this fails, `E.I` is an invalid member reference, and a binding-time error occurs.

#### Identical simple names and type names

In a member access of the form `E.I`, if `E` is a single identifier, and if the meaning of `E` as a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) is a constant, field, property, local variable, or parameter with the same type as the meaning of `E` as a *type-name* (§8.8.1), then both possible meanings of `E` are permitted. The member lookup of `E.I` is never ambiguous, since `I` shall necessarily be a member of the type `E` in both cases. In other words, the rule simply permits access to the static members and nested types of `E` where a compile-time error would otherwise have occurred. [*Example*:

```csharp
struct Color
{
    public static readonly Color White = new Color (…);
    public static readonly Color Black = new Color (…);

    public Color Complement () {…}
}

class A
{
    public Color Color; // Field Color of type Color

    void F ()
    {
        Color = Color.Black; // Refs Color.Black static member
        Color = Color.Complement (); // Invokes Complement() on Color fld
    }

    static void G ()
    {
        Color c = Color.White; // Refs Color.White static member
    }
}
```

Within the `A` class, those occurrences of the `Color` identifier that reference the `Color` type are underlined, and those that reference the `Color` field are not underlined. *end example*]

### Invocation expressions

#### General

An *invocation-expression* is used to invoke a method.

```antlr
invocation-expression:
    primary-expression ( argument-listopt )
```

An *invocation-expression* is dynamically bound (§12.3.3) if at least one of the following holds:

- The *primary-expression* has compile-time type `dynamic`.
- At least one argument of the optional *argument-list* has compile-time type `dynamic`.

In this case, the compiler classifies the *invocation-expression* as a value of type `dynamic`. The rules below to determine the meaning of the *invocation-expression* are then applied at run-time, using the run-time type instead of the compile-time type of those of the *primary-expression* and arguments that have the compile-time type `dynamic`. If the *primary-expression* does not have compile-time type `dynamic`, then the method invocation undergoes a limited compile-time check as described in §12.6.5.

The *primary-expression* of an *invocation-expression* shall be a method group or a value of a *delegate-type*. If the *primary-expression* is a method group, the *invocation-expression* is a method invocation (§12.7.6.2). If the *primary-expression* is a value of a *delegate-type*, the *invocation-expression* is a delegate invocation (§12.7.6.4). If the *primary-expression* is neither a method group nor a value of a *delegate-type*, a binding-time error occurs.

The optional *argument-list* (§12.6.2) provides values or variable references for the parameters of the method.

The result of evaluating an *invocation-expression* is classified as follows:

- If the *invocation-expression* invokes a method or delegate that returns void, the result is nothing. An expression that is classified as nothing is permitted only in the context of a *statement-expression* (§13.7) or as the body of a *lambda-expression* (§12.16). Otherwise a binding-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, the result is a value, with an associated type of the return type of the method or delegate. If the invocation is of an instance method, and the receiver is of a class type `T`, the associated type is picked from the first declaration or override of the method found when starting with `T` and searching through its base classes.

#### Method invocations

For a method invocation, the *primary-expression* of the *invocation-expression* shall be a method group. The method group identifies the one method to invoke or the set of overloaded methods from which to choose a specific method to invoke. In the latter case, determination of the specific method to invoke is based on the context provided by the types of the arguments in the *argument-list*.

The binding-time processing of a method invocation of the form `M(A)`, where `M` is a method group (possibly including a *type-argument-list*), and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

- The set of candidate methods for the method invocation is constructed. For each method `F` associated with the method group `M`:
  - If `F` is non-generic, `F` is a candidate when:
    - `M` has no type argument list, and
    - `F` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2).
  - If `F` is generic and `M` has no type argument list, `F` is a candidate when:
    - Type inference (§12.6.3) succeeds, inferring a list of type arguments for the call, and
    - Once the inferred type arguments are substituted for the corresponding method type parameters, all constructed types in the parameter list of `F` satisfy their constraints (§9.4.5), and the parameter list of `F` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2)
  - If `F` is generic and `M` includes a type argument list, `F` is a candidate when:
    - `F` has the same number of method type parameters as were supplied in the type argument list, and
    - Once the type arguments are substituted for the corresponding method type parameters, all constructed types in the parameter list of `F` satisfy their constraints (§9.4.5), and the parameter list of `F` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2).
- The set of candidate methods is reduced to contain only methods from the most derived types: For each method `C.F` in the set, where `C` is the type in which the method `F` is declared, all methods declared in a base type of `C` are removed from the set. Furthermore, if `C` is a class type other than `object`, all methods declared in an interface type are removed from the set. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > This latter rule only has an effect when the method group was the result of a member lookup on a type parameter having an effective base class other than object and a non-empty effective interface set.
- If the resulting set of candidate methods is empty, then further processing along the following steps are abandoned, and instead an attempt is made to process the invocation as an extension method invocation (§12.7.6.3). If this fails, then no applicable methods exist, and a binding-time error occurs.
- The best method of the set of candidate methods is identified using the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. If a single best method cannot be identified, the method invocation is ambiguous, and a binding-time error occurs. When performing overload resolution, the parameters of a generic method are considered after substituting the type arguments (supplied or inferred) for the corresponding method type parameters.
- ***Final validation*** of the chosen best method is performed:
  - The method is validated in the context of the method group: If the best method is a static method, the method group shall have resulted from a *simple-name* or a *member-access* through a type. If the best method is an instance method, the method group shall have resulted from a *simple-name*, a *member-access* through a variable or value, or a *base-access*. If neither of these requirements is true, a binding-time error occurs.
  - If the best method is a generic method, the type arguments (supplied or inferred) are checked against the constraints (§9.4.5) declared on the generic method. If any type argument does not satisfy the corresponding constraint(s) on the type parameter, a binding-time error occurs.

Once a method has been selected and validated at binding-time by the above steps, the actual run-time invocation is processed according to the rules of function member invocation described in §12.6.6.

> [!NOTE]
> The intuitive effect of the resolution rules described above is as follows: To locate the particular method invoked by a method invocation, start with the type indicated by the method invocation and proceed up the inheritance chain until at least one applicable, accessible, non-override method declaration is found. Then perform type inference and overload resolution on the set of applicable, accessible, non-override methods declared in that type and invoke the method thus selected. If no method was found, try instead to process the invocation as an extension-method invocation.

#### Extension method invocations

In a method invocation (§12.6.6.2) of one of the forms

```
expr . identifier ( )
expr . identifier ( args )
expr . identifier < typeargs > ( )
expr . identifier < typeargs > ( args )
```

if the normal processing of the invocation finds no applicable methods, an attempt is made to process the construct as an extension method invocation. If *expr* or any of the *args* has compile-time type dynamic, extension methods will not apply.

The objective is to find the best *type-name* `C`, so that the corresponding static method invocation can take place:

```
C . identifier ( expr )

C . identifier ( expr , args )

C . identifier < typeargs > ( expr )

C . identifier < typeargs > ( expr , args )
```

An extension method `Ci.Mj` is ***eligible*** if:

- `Ci` is a non-generic, non-nested class
- The name of `Mj` is *identifier*
- `Mj` is accessible and applicable when applied to the arguments as a static method as shown above
- An implicit identity, reference or boxing conversion exists from *expr* to the type of the first parameter of `Mj`.

The search for C proceeds as follows:

- Starting with the closest enclosing namespace declaration, continuing with each enclosing namespace declaration, and ending with the containing compilation unit, successive attempts are made to find a candidate set of extension methods:
  - If the given namespace or compilation unit directly contains non-generic type declarations `Ci` with eligible extension methods `Mj`, then the set of those extension methods is the candidate set.
  - If namespaces imported by using namespace directives in the given namespace or compilation unit directly contain non-generic type declarations `Ci` with eligible extension methods `Mj`, then the set of those extension methods is the candidate set.
- If no candidate set is found in any enclosing namespace declaration or compilation unit, a compile-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, overload resolution is applied to the candidate set as described in §12.6.4. If no single best method is found, a compile-time error occurs.
- `C` is the type within which the best method is declared as an extension method.

Using `C` as a target, the method call is then processed as a static method invocation (§12.6.6). 

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike an instance method invocation, no exception is thrown when *expr* evaluates to a null reference. Instead, this null value is passed to the extension method as it would be via a regular static method invocation. It is up to the extension method implementation to decide how to respond to such a call.

The preceding rules mean that instance methods take precedence over extension methods, that extension methods available in inner namespace declarations take precedence over extension methods available in outer namespace declarations, and that extension methods declared directly in a namespace take precedence over extension methods imported into that same namespace with a using namespace directive. [*Example*:

```csharp
public static class E
{
    public static void F (this object obj, int i) { }

    public static void F (this object obj, string s) { }
}

class A { }

class B
{
    public void F (int i) { }
}

class C
{
    public void F (object obj) { }
}

class X
{
    static void Test (A a, B b, C c)
    {
        a.F (1); // E.F(object, int)
        a.F ("hello"); // E.F(object, string)

        b.F (1); // B.F(int)
        b.F ("hello"); // E.F(object, string)

        c.F (1); // C.F(object)
        c.F ("hello"); // C.F(object)
    }
}
```

In the example, `B`’s method takes precedence over the first extension method, and `C`’s method takes precedence over both extension methods.

```csharp
public static class C
{
    public static void F (this int i) { Console.WriteLine ("C.F({0})", i); }
    public static void G (this int i) { Console.WriteLine ("C.G({0})", i); }
    public static void H (this int i) { Console.WriteLine ("C.H({0})", i); }
}

namespace N1
{
    public static class D
    {
        public static void F (this int i) { Console.WriteLine ("D.F({0})", i); }
        public static void G (this int i) { Console.WriteLine ("D.G({0})", i); }
    }
}

namespace N2
{
    using N1;

    public static class E
    {
        public static void F (this int i) { Console.WriteLine ("E.F({0})", i); }
    }

    class Test
    {
        static void Main (string[] args)
        {
            1. F ();
            2. G ();
            3. H ();
        }
    }
}
```
The output of this example is:

```
E.F(1)
D.G(2)
C.H(3)
```

`D.G` takes precendece over `C.G`, and `E.F` takes precedence over both `D.F` and `C.F`. *end example*]

#### Delegate invocations

For a delegate invocation, the *primary-expression* of the *invocation-expression* shall be a value of a *delegate-type*. Furthermore, considering the *delegate-type* to be a function member with the same parameter list as the *delegate-type*, the *delegate-type* shall be applicable (§12.6.4.2) with respect to the *argument-list* of the *invocation-expression*.

The run-time processing of a delegate invocation of the form `D(A)`, where `D` is a *primary-expression* of a *delegate-type* and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

- `D` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.
- The argument list `A` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.
- The value of `D` is checked to be valid. If the value of `D` is `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
- Otherwise, `D` is a reference to a delegate instance. Function member invocations (§12.6.6) are performed on each of the callable entities in the invocation list of the delegate. For callable entities consisting of an instance and instance method, the instance for the invocation is the instance contained in the callable entity.

See §20.6 for details of multiple invocation lists without parameters.

### Element access

#### General

An *element-access* consists of a *primary-no-array-creation-expression*, followed by a “`[`” token, followed by an *argument-list*, followed by a “`]`” token. The *argument-list* consists of one or more *argument*s, separated by commas.

```antlr
element-access:
    primary-no-array-creation-expression [ argument-list ]
```

The *argument-list* of an *element-access* is not allowed to contain `ref` or `out` arguments.

An *element-access* is dynamically bound (§12.3.3) if at least one of the following holds:

- The *primary-no-array-creation-expression* has compile-time type `dynamic`.
- At least one expression of the *argument-list* has compile-time type dynamic and the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* does not have an array type.

In this case, the compiler classifies the *element-access* as a value of type `dynamic`. The rules below to determine the meaning of the *element-access* are then applied at run-time, using the run-time type instead of the compile-time type of those of the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* and *argument-list* expressions which have the compile-time type `dynamic`. If the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* does not have compile-time type `dynamic`, then the element access undergoes a limited compile-time check as described in §12.6.5.

If the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of an *element-access* is a value of an *array-type*, the *element-access* is an array access (§12.7.7.2). Otherwise, the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* shall be a variable or value of a class, struct, or interface type that has one or more indexer members, in which case the *element-access* is an indexer access (§12.7.7.3).

#### Array access

For an array access, the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of the *element-access* shall be a value of an *array-type*. Furthermore, the *argument-list* of an array access is not allowed to contain named arguments.The number of expressions in the *argument-list* shall be the same as the rank of the *array-type*, and each expression shall be of type `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, or shall be implicitly convertible to one or more of these types.

The result of evaluating an array access is a variable of the element type of the array, namely the array element selected by the value(s) of the expression(s) in the *argument-list*.

The run-time processing of an array access of the form `P[A]`, where `P` is a *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of an *array-type* and `A` is an *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

- `P` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.
- The index expressions of the *argument-list* are evaluated in order, from left to right. Following evaluation of each index expression, an implicit conversion (§11.2) to one of the following types is performed: `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`. The first type in this list for which an implicit conversion exists is chosen. For instance, if the index expression is of type short then an implicit conversion to int is performed, since implicit conversions from short to int and from short to long are possible. If evaluation of an index expression or the subsequent implicit conversion causes an exception, then no further index expressions are evaluated and no further steps are executed.
- The value of `P` is checked to be valid. If the value of `P` is `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
- The value of each expression in the *argument-list* is checked against the actual bounds of each dimension of the array instance referenced by `P`. If one or more values are out of range, a `System.IndexOutOfRangeException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
- The location of the array element given by the index expression(s) is computed, and this location becomes the result of the array access.

#### Indexer access

For an indexer access, the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of the *element-access* shall be a variable or value of a class, struct, or interface type, and this type shall implement one or more indexers that are applicable with respect to the *argument-list* of the *element-access*.

The binding-time processing of an indexer access of the form `P[A]`, where `P` is a *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of a class, struct, or interface type `T`, and `A` is an *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

- The set of indexers provided by `T` is constructed. The set consists of all indexers declared in `T` or a base type of `T` that are not override declarations and are accessible in the current context (§8.5).
- The set is reduced to those indexers that are applicable and not hidden by other indexers. The following rules are applied to each indexer `S.I` in the set, where `S` is the type in which the indexer `I` is declared:
  - If `I` is not applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2), then `I` is removed from the set.
  - If `I` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2), then all indexers declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.
  - If `I` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2) and `S` is a class type other than object, all indexers declared in an interface are removed from the set.
- If the resulting set of candidate indexers is empty, then no applicable indexers exist, and a binding-time error occurs.
- The best indexer of the set of candidate indexers is identified using the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. If a single best indexer cannot be identified, the indexer access is ambiguous, and a binding-time error occurs.
- The index expressions of the *argument-list* are evaluated in order, from left to right. The result of processing the indexer access is an expression classified as an indexer access. The indexer access expression references the indexer determined in the step above, and has an associated instance expression of `P` and an associated argument list of A, and an associated type that is the type of the indexer. If `T` is a class type, the associated type is picked from the first declaration or override of the indexer found when starting with `T` and searching through its base classes.

Depending on the context in which it is used, an indexer access causes invocation of either the *get-accessor* or the *set-accessor* of the indexer. If the indexer access is the target of an assignment, the *set-accessor* is invoked to assign a new value (§12.18.2). In all other cases, the *get-accessor* is invoked to obtain the current value (§12.2.2).

### This access

A *this-access* consists of the keyword `this`.

```antlr
this-access:
    this
```

A *this-access* is permitted only in the *block* of an instance constructor, an instance method, an instance accessor (§12.2.1), or a finalizer. It has one of the following meanings:

- When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance constructor of a class, it is classified as a value. The type of the value is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the class within which the usage occurs, and the value is a reference to the object being constructed.
- When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance method or instance accessor of a class, it is classified as a value. The type of the value is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the class within which the usage occurs, and the value is a reference to the object for which the method or accessor was invoked.
- When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance constructor of a struct, it is classified as a variable. The type of the variable is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the struct within which the usage occurs, and the variable represents the struct being constructed.
  - If the constructor declaration has no constructor initializer, the this variable behaves exactly the same as an out parameter of the struct type. In particular, this means that the variable shall be definitely assigned in every execution path of the instance constructor.
  - Otherwise, the this variable behaves exactly the same as a ref parameter of the struct type. In particular, this means that the variable is considered initially assigned.
- When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance method or instance accessor of a struct, it is classified as a variable. The type of the variable is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the struct within which the usage occurs.
  - If the method or accessor is not an iterator (§15.14) or async function (§15.15), the this variable represents the struct for which the method or accessor was invoked, and behaves exactly the same as a ref parameter of the struct type.
  - If the method or accessor is an iterator or async function, the this variable represents a *copy* of the struct for which the method or accessor was invoked, and behaves exactly the same as a *value* parameter of the struct type.

Use of this in a *primary-expression* in a context other than the ones listed above is a compile-time error. In particular, it is not possible to refer to this in a static method, a static property accessor, or in a *variable-initializer* of a field declaration.

### Base access

A *base-access* consists of the keyword base followed by either a “`.`” token and an identifier and optional *type-argument-list* or an *argument-list* enclosed in square brackets:

```antlr
base-access:
    base . identifier type-argument-listopt
    base [ argument-list ]
```

A *base-access* is used to access base class members that are hidden by similarly named members in the current class or struct. A *base-access* is permitted only in the *block* of an instance constructor, an instance method, an instance accessor (§12.2.1), or a finalizer. When `base.I` occurs in a class or struct, `I` shall denote a member of the base class of that class or struct. Likewise, when `base[E]` occurs in a class, an applicable indexer shall exist in the base class.

At binding-time, *base-access* expressions of the form `base.I` and `base[E]` are evaluated exactly as if they were written `((B)this).I` and `((B)this)[E]`, where `B` is the base class of the class or struct in which the construct occurs. Thus, `base.I` and `base[E]` correspond to `this.I` and `this[E]`, except this is viewed as an instance of the base class.

When a *base-access* references a virtual function member (a method, property, or indexer), the determination of which function member to invoke at run-time (§12.6.6) is changed. The function member that is invoked is determined by finding the most derived implementation (§15.6.4) of the function member with respect to `B` (instead of with respect to the run-time type of this, as would be usual in a non-base access). Thus, within an override of a virtual function member, a *base-access* can be used to invoke the inherited implementation of the function member. If the function member referenced by a *base-access* is abstract, a binding-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike this, base is not an expression in itself. It is a keyword only used in the context of a *base-access* or a *constructor-initializer* (§15.11.2).

### Postfix increment and decrement operators

```antlr
post-increment-expression:
    primary-expression ++

post-decrement-expression:
    primary-expression --
```

The operand of a postfix increment or decrement operation shall be an expression classified as a variable, a property access, or an indexer access. The result of the operation is a value of the same type as the operand.

If the *primary-expression* has the compile-time type dynamic then the operator is dynamically bound (§12.3.3), the *post-increment-expression* or *post-decrement-expression* has the compile-time type `dynamic` and the following rules are applied at run-time using the run-time type of the *primary-expression*.

If the operand of a postfix increment or decrement operation is a property or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have both a get and a set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

Unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. Predefined `++` and `--` operators exist for the following types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, and any enum type. The predefined `++` operators return the value produced by adding `1` to the operand, and the predefined `--` operators return the value produced by subtracting `1` from the operand. In a checked context, if the result of this addition or subtraction is outside the range of the result type and the result type is an integral type or enum type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.

There shall be an implicit conversion from the return type of the selected unary operator to the type of the *primary-expression*, otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a postfix increment or decrement operation of the form `x++` or `x--` consists of the following steps:

- If `x` is classified as a variable:
  - `x` is evaluated to produce the variable.
  - The value of `x` is saved.
  - The saved value of `x` is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and the operator is invoked with this value as its argument.
  - The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `x` and stored in the location given by the earlier evaluation of `x`.
  - The saved value of `x` becomes the result of the operation.
- If `x` is classified as a property or indexer access:
  - The instance expression (if `x` is not static) and the argument list (if `x` is an indexer access) associated with `x` are evaluated, and the results are used in the subsequent get and set accessor invocations.
  - The get accessor of `x` is invoked and the returned value is saved.
  - The saved value of `x` is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and the operator is invoked with this value as its argument.
  - The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `x` and the set accessor of `x` is invoked with this value as its value argument.
  - The saved value of `x` becomes the result of the operation.

The `++` and `--` operators also support prefix notation (§12.8.6). Typically, the result of `x++` or `x--` is the value of `x` *before* the operation, whereas the result of `++x` or `--x` is the value of `x` *after* the operation. In either case, `x` itself has the same value after the operation.

An operator `++ `or operator `--` implementation can be invoked using either postfix or prefix notation. It is not possible to have separate operator implementations for the two notations.

### The new operator

#### General

The `new` operator is used to create new instances of types.

There are three forms of `new` expressions:

- Object creation expressions and anonymous object creation expressions are used to create new instances of class types and value types.
- Array creation expressions are used to create new instances of array types.
- Delegate creation expressions are used to obtain instances of delegate types.

The `new` operator implies creation of an instance of a type, but does not necessarily imply allocation of memory. In particular, instances of value types require no additional memory beyond the variables in which they reside, and no allocations occur when `new` is used to create instances of value types.

> [!NOTE]
> Delegate creation expressions do not always create new instances. When the expression is processed in the same way as a method group conversion (§11.8) or an anonymous function conversion (§11.7) this may result in an existing delegate instance being reused. 

#### Object creation expressions

An *object-creation-expression* is used to create a new instance of a *class-type* or a *value-type*.

```antlr
object-creation-expression:
    new type ( argument-listopt ) object-or-collection-initializeropt
    new type object-or-collection-initializer

object-or-collection-initializer:
    object-initializer
    collection-initializer
```

The *type* of an *object-creation-expression* shall be a *class-type*, a *value-type*, or a *type-parameter*. The *type* cannot be an abstract or static *class-type*.

The optional *argument-list* (§12.6.2) is permitted only if the *type* is a *class-type* or a *struct-type*.

An object creation expression can omit the constructor argument list and enclosing parentheses provided it includes an object initializer or collection initializer. Omitting the constructor argument list and enclosing parentheses is equivalent to specifying an empty argument list.

Processing of an object creation expression that includes an object initializer or collection initializer consists of first processing the instance constructor and then processing the member or element initializations specified by the object initializer (§12.7.11.3) or collection initializer (§12.7.11.4).

If any of the arguments in the optional argument-list has the compile-time type dynamic then the *object-creation-expression* is dynamically bound (§12.3.3) and the following rules are applied at run-time using the run-time type of those arguments of the *argument-list* that have the compile-time type dynamic. However, the object creation undergoes a limited compile-time check as described in §12.6.5.

The binding-time processing of an *object-creation-expression* of the form new `T(A)`, where `T` is a *class-type*, or a *value*-*type*, and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

- If `T` is a *value-type* and `A` is not present:
  - The *object-creation-expression* is a default constructor invocation. The result of the *object-creation-expression* is a value of type `T`, namely the default value for `T` as defined in §9.3.3.
- Otherwise, if `T` is a *type-parameter* and `A` is not present:
  - If no value type constraint or constructor constraint (§15.2.5) has been specified for `T`, a binding-time error occurs.
  - The result of the *object-creation-expression* is a value of the run-time type that the type parameter has been bound to, namely the result of invoking the default constructor of that type. The run-time type may be a reference type or a value type.
- Otherwise, if `T` is a *class-type* or a *struct-type*:
  - If `T` is an abstract or static *class-type*, a compile-time error occurs.
  - The instance constructor to invoke is determined using the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. The set of candidate instance constructors consists of all accessible instance constructors declared in `T`, which are applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2). If the set of candidate instance constructors is empty, or if a single best instance constructor cannot be identified, a binding-time error occurs.
  - The result of the *object-creation-expression* is a value of type `T`, namely the value produced by invoking the instance constructor determined in the step above.
  - Otherwise, the *object-creation-expression* is invalid, and a binding-time error occurs.

Even if the *object-creation-expression* is dynamically bound, the compile-time type is still `T`.

The run-time processing of an *object-creation-expression* of the form new `T(A)`, where `T` is *class-type* or a *struct-type* and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

- If `T` is a *class-type*:
  - A new instance of class `T` is allocated. If there is not enough memory available to allocate the new instance, a `System.OutOfMemoryException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
  - All fields of the new instance are initialized to their default values (§10.3).
  - The instance constructor is invoked according to the rules of function member invocation (§12.6.6). A reference to the newly allocated instance is automatically passed to the instance constructor and the instance can be accessed from within that constructor as `this`.
- If `T` is a *struct-type*:
  - An instance of type `T` is created by allocating a temporary local variable. Since an instance constructor of a *struct-type* is required to definitely assign a value to each field of the instance being created, no initialization of the temporary variable is necessary.
  - The instance constructor is invoked according to the rules of function member invocation (§12.6.6). A reference to the newly allocated instance is automatically passed to the instance constructor and the instance can be accessed from within that constructor as `this`.

#### Object initializers

An ***object initializer*** specifies values for zero or more fields or properties of an object.

```antlr
object-initializer:
    { member-initializer-listopt }
    { member-initializer-list , }

member-initializer-list:
    member-initializer
    member-initializer-list , member-initializer

member-initializer:
    identifier = initializer-value

initializer-value:
    expression
    object-or-collection-initializer
```

An object initializer consists of a sequence of member initializers, enclosed by `{` and `}` tokens and separated by commas. Each member initializer shall name an accessible field or property of the object being initialized, followed by an equals sign and an expression or an object initializer or collection initializer. It is an error for an object initializer to include more than one member initializer for the same field or property. It is not possible for the object initializer to refer to the newly created object it is initializing.

A member initializer that specifies an expression after the equals sign is processed in the same way as an assignment (§12.18.2) to the field or property.

A member initializer that specifies an object initializer after the equals sign is a ***nested object initializer***, i.e., an initialization of an embedded object. Instead of assigning a new value to the field or property, the assignments in the nested object initializer are treated as assignments to members of the field or property. Nested object initializers cannot be applied to properties with a value type, or to read-only fields with a value type.

A member initializer that specifies a collection initializer after the equals sign is an initialization of an embedded collection. Instead of assigning a new collection to the field or property, the elements given in the initializer are added to the collection referenced by the field or property. The field or property shall be of a collection type that satisfies the requirements specified in §12.7.11.4.

[*Example*:The following class represents a point with two coordinates:

```csharp
public class Point
{
    int x, y;

    public int X { get { return x; } set { x = value; } }
    public int Y { get { return y; } set { y = value; } }
}
```

An instance of Point can be created and initialized as follows:

```csharp
Point a = new Point { X = 0, Y = 1 };
```

which has the same effect as

```csharp
Point __a = new Point ();
__a.X = 0;
__a.Y = 1;
Point a = __a;
```

where `__a` is an otherwise invisible and inaccessible temporary variable. The following class represents a rectangle created from two points:

```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
    Point p1, p2;

    public Point P1 { get { return p1; } set { p1 = value; } }
    public Point P2 { get { return p2; } set { p2 = value; } }
}
```

An instance of `Rectangle` can be created and initialized as follows:

```csharp
Rectangle r = new Rectangle
{
    P1 = new Point { X = 0, Y = 1 },
    P2 = new Point { X = 2, Y = 3 }
};
```

which has the same effect as

```csharp
Rectangle __r = new Rectangle ();
Point __p1 = new Point ();
__p1.X = 0;
__p1.Y = 1;
__r.P1 = __p1;
Point __p2 = new Point ();
__p2.X = 2;
__p2.Y = 3;
__r.P2 = __p2;
Rectangle r = __r;
```

where `__r`, `__p1` and `__p2` are temporary variables that are otherwise invisible and inaccessible.

If `Rectangle`’s constructor allocates the two embedded `Point` instances

```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
    Point p1 = new Point ();
    Point p2 = new Point ();

    public Point P1 { get { return p1; } }
    public Point P2 { get { return p2; } }
}
```

the following construct can be used to initialize the embedded `Point` instances instead of assigning new instances:

```csharp
Rectangle r = new Rectangle
{
    P1 = { X = 0, Y = 1 },
    P2 = { X = 2, Y = 3 }
};
```

which has the same effect as

```csharp
Rectangle __r = new Rectangle ();
__r.P1.X = 0;
__r.P1.Y = 1;
__r.P2.X = 2;
__r.P2.Y = 3;
Rectangle r = __r;
```

*end example*]

#### Collection initializers

A collection initializer specifies the elements of a collection.

```antlr
collection-initializer:
    { element-initializer-list }
    { element-initializer-list , }

element-initializer-list:
    element-initializer
    element-initializer-list , element-initializer

element-initializer:
    non-assignment-expression
    { expression-list }

expression-list:
    expression
    expression-list , expression
```

A collection initializer consists of a sequence of element initializers, enclosed by `{` and `}` tokens and separated by commas. Each element initializer specifies an element to be added to the collection object being initialized, and consists of a list of expressions enclosed by `{` and `}` tokens and separated by commas. A single-expression element initializer can be written without braces, but cannot then be an assignment expression, to avoid ambiguity with member initializers. The *non-assignment-expression* production is defined in §12.19.

[*Example*:

The following is an example of an object creation expression that includes a collection initializer:

```csharp
List<int> digits = new List<int> { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
```

*end example*]

The collection object to which a collection initializer is applied shall be of a type that implements System.Collections.IEnumerable or a compile-time error occurs. For each specified element in order, the collection initializer invokes an Add method on the target object with the expression list of the element initializer as argument list, applying normal overload resolution for each invocation. Thus, the collection object shall contain an applicable Add method for each element initializer.

[*Example*:The following class represents a contact with a name and a list of phone numbers:

```csharp
public class Contact
{
    string name;
    List<string> phoneNumbers = new List<string> ();

    public string Name { get { return name; } set { name = value; } }

    public List<string> PhoneNumbers { get { return phoneNumbers; } }
}
```

A `List<Contact>` can be created and initialized as follows:

```csharp
var contacts = new List<Contact>
{
    new Contact
    {
    Name = "Chris Smith",
    PhoneNumbers = { "206-555-0101", "425-882-8080" }
    },
    new Contact
    {
    Name = "Bob Harris",
    PhoneNumbers = { "650-555-0199" }
    }
};
```

which has the same effect as

```csharp
var __clist = new List<Contact> ();
Contact __c1 = new Contact ();
__c1.Name = "Chris Smith";
__c1.PhoneNumbers.Add ("206-555-0101");
__c1.PhoneNumbers.Add ("425-882-8080");
__clist.Add (__c1);
Contact __c2 = new Contact ();
__c2.Name = "Bob Harris";
__c2.PhoneNumbers.Add ("650-555-0199");
__clist.Add (__c2);
var contacts = __clist;
```

where `__clist`, `__c1` and `__c2` are temporary variables that are otherwise invisible and inaccessible. *end example*]

#### Array creation expressions

An *array-creation-expression* is used to create a new instance of an *array-type*.

```antlr
array-creation-expression:
    new non-array-type [ expression-list ] rank-specifiersopt array-initializeropt
    new array-type array-initializer
    new rank-specifier array-initializer
```

An array creation expression of the first form allocates an array instance of the type that results from deleting each of the individual expressions from the expression list. [*Example*: The array creation expression new `int[10,20]` produces an array instance of type `int[,]`, and the array creation expression new `int[10][,]` produces an array instance of type `int[][,]`. *end example*] Each expression in the expression list shall be of type `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong`, or implicitly convertible to one or more of these types. The value of each expression determines the length of the corresponding dimension in the newly allocated array instance. Since the length of an array dimension shall be nonnegative, it is a compile-time error to have a constant expression with a negative value, in the expression list.

Except in an `unsafe` context (§23.2), the layout of arrays is unspecified.

If an array creation expression of the first form includes an array initializer, each expression in the expression list shall be a constant and the rank and dimension lengths specified by the expression list shall match those of the array initializer.

In an array creation expression of the second or third form, the rank of the specified array type or rank specifier shall match that of the array initializer. The individual dimension lengths are inferred from the number of elements in each of the corresponding nesting levels of the array initializer. Thus, the expression

```csharp
new int[, ] { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 }, { 4, 5 } }
```

exactly corresponds to

```csharp
new int[3, 2] { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 }, { 4, 5 } }
```

An array creation expression of the third form is referred to as an ***implicitly typed array-creation expression***. It is similar to the second form, except that the element type of the array is not explicitly given, but determined as the best common type (§12.6.3.15) of the set of expressions in the array initializer. For a multidimensional array, i.e., one where the *rank-specifier* contains at least one comma, this set comprises all *expression*s found in nested *array-initializer*s.

Array initializers are described further in §17.7.

The result of evaluating an array creation expression is classified as a value, namely a reference to the newly allocated array instance. The run-time processing of an array creation expression consists of the following steps:

- The dimension length expressions of the *expression-list* are evaluated in order, from left to right. Following evaluation of each expression, an implicit conversion (§11.2) to one of the following types is performed: `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`. The first type in this list for which an implicit conversion exists is chosen. If evaluation of an expression or the subsequent implicit conversion causes an exception, then no further expressions are evaluated and no further steps are executed.
- The computed values for the dimension lengths are validated, as follows: If one or more of the values are less than zero, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
- An array instance with the given dimension lengths is allocated. If there is not enough memory available to allocate the new instance, a `System.OutOfMemoryException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
- All elements of the new array instance are initialized to their default values (§10.3).
- If the array creation expression contains an array initializer, then each expression in the array initializer is evaluated and assigned to its corresponding array element. The evaluations and assignments are performed in the order the expressions are written in the array initializer—in other words, elements are initialized in increasing index order, with the rightmost dimension increasing first. If evaluation of a given expression or the subsequent assignment to the corresponding array element causes an exception, then no further elements are initialized (and the remaining elements will thus have their default values).

An array creation expression permits instantiation of an array with elements of an array type, but the elements of such an array shall be manually initialized. [*Example*: The statement

```csharp
int[][] a = new int[100][];
```

creates a single-dimensional array with 100 elements of type `int[]`. The initial value of each element is `null`. It is not possible for the same array creation expression to also instantiate the sub-arrays, and the statement

```csharp
int[][] a = new int[100][5]; // Error
```

results in a compile-time error. Instantiation of the sub-arrays can instead be performed manually, as in

```csharp
int[][] a = new int[100][];
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) a[i] = new int[5];
```

> [!NOTE]
> When an array of arrays has a “rectangular” shape, that is when the sub-arrays are all of the same length, it is more efficient to use a multi-dimensional array. In the example above, instantiation of the array of arrays creates 101 objects—one outer array and 100 sub-arrays. In contrast,
> 
> ```csharp
> int[,] = new int[100, 5];
> ```
> 
> creates only a single object, a two-dimensional array, and accomplishes the allocation in a single statement. 

[*Example*: The following are examples of implicitly typed array creation expressions:

```csharp
var a = new [] { 1, 10, 100, 1000 }; // int[]

var b = new [] { 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 }; // double[]

var c = new [, ] { { "hello", null }, { "world", "!" } }; // string[,]

var d = new [] { 1, "one", 2, "two" }; // Error
```

The last expression causes a compile-time error because neither `int` nor `string` is implicitly convertible to the other, and so there is no best common type. An explicitly typed array creation expression must be used in this case, for example specifying the type to be `object[]`. Alternatively, one of the elements can be cast to a common base type, which would then become the inferred element type. *end example*]

Implicitly typed array creation expressions can be combined with anonymous object initializers (§12.7.11.7) to create anonymously typed data structures. [*Example*:

```csharp
var contacts = new []
{
    new
    {
    Name = "Chris Smith",
    PhoneNumbers = new [] { "206-555-0101", "425-882-8080" }
    },
    new
    {
    Name = "Bob Harris",
    PhoneNumbers = new [] { "650-555-0199" }
    }
};
```

*end example*]

#### Delegate creation expressions

A *delegate-creation-expression* is used to obtain an instance of a *delegate-type*.

```antlr
delegate-creation-expression:
    new delegate-type ( expression )
```

The argument of a delegate creation expression shall be a method group, an anonymous function, or a value of either the compile-time type dynamic or a *delegate-type*. If the argument is a method group, it identifies the method and, for an instance method, the object for which to create a delegate. If the argument is an anonymous function it directly defines the parameters and method body of the delegate target. If the argument is a value it identifies a delegate instance of which to create a copy.

If the *expression* has the compile-time type `dynamic`, the *delegate-creation-expression* is dynamically bound (§12.7.11.6), and the rules below are applied at run-time using the run-time type of the *expression*. Otherwise, the rules are applied at compile-time.

The binding-time processing of a *delegate-creation-expression* of the form `new D(E)`, where `D` is a *delegate-type* and `E` is an *expression*, consists of the following steps:

- If `E` is a method group, the delegate creation expression is processed in the same way as a method group conversion (§11.8) from `E` to `D`.
- If `E` is an anonymous function, the delegate creation expression is processed in the same way as an anonymous function conversion (§11.7) from `E` to `D`.
- If `E` is a value, `E` shall be compatible (§20.2) with `D`, and the result is a reference to a newly created delegate with a single-entry invocation list that invokes  `E`.

The run-time processing of a *delegate-creation-expression* of the form new `D(E)`, where `D` is a *delegate-type* and `E` is an *expression*, consists of the following steps:

- If `E` is a method group, the delegate creation expression is evaluated as a method group conversion (§11.8) from `E` to `D`.
- If `E` is an anonymous function, the delegate creation is evaluated as an anonymous function conversion from `E` to `D` (§11.7).
- If `E` is a value of a *delegate-type*:
  - `E` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.
  - If the value of `E` is `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
  - A new instance of the delegate type `D` is allocated. If there is not enough memory available to allocate the new instance, a `System.OutOfMemoryException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.
  - The new delegate instance is initialized with a single-entry invocation list that invokes `E`.

The invocation list of a delegate is determined when the delegate is instantiated and then remains constant for the entire lifetime of the delegate. In other words, it is not possible to change the target callable entities of a delegate once it has been created. 

> [!NOTE]
> Remember, when two delegates are combined or one is removed from another, a new delegate results; no existing delegate has its content changed.

It is not possible to create a delegate that refers to a property, indexer, user-defined operator, instance constructor, finalizer, or static constructor.

[*Example*: As described above, when a delegate is created from a method group, the formal parameter list and return type of the delegate determine which of the overloaded methods to select. In the example

```csharp
delegate double DoubleFunc (double x);

class A
{
    DoubleFunc f = new DoubleFunc (Square);

    static float Square (float x)
    {
        return x * x;
    }

    static double Square (double x)
    {
        return x * x;
    }
}
```

the `A.f` field is initialized with a delegate that refers to the second `Square` method because that method exactly matches the formal parameter list and return type of `DoubleFunc`. Had the second `Square` method not been present, a compile-time error would have occurred. *end example*]

#### Anonymous object creation expressions

An *anonymous-object-creation-expression* is used to create an object of an anonymous type.

```antlr
anonymous-object-creation-expression:
    new anonymous-object-initializer

anonymous-object-initializer:
    { member-declarator-listopt }
    { member-declarator-list , }

member-declarator-list:
    member-declarator
    member-declarator-list , member-declarator

member-declarator:
    simple-name
    member-access
    base-access
    identifier = expression
```

An anonymous object initializer declares an anonymous type and returns an instance of that type. An anonymous type is a nameless class type that inherits directly from object. The members of an anonymous type are a sequence of read-only properties inferred from the anonymous object initializer used to create an instance of the type. Specifically, an anonymous object initializer of the form

```csharp
new { p1 = e1 , p2 = e2 , … pn = en }
```

declares an anonymous type of the form

```csharp
class __Anonymous1
{
    private readonly T1 f1;
    private readonly T2 f2;
    …
    private readonly Tn fn;

    public __Anonymous1 (T1 a1, T2 a2, …, Tn an)
    {
        f1 = a1;
        f2 = a2;
        …
        fn = an;
    }

    public T1 p1 { get { return f1; } }
    public T2 p2 { get { return f2; } }…
    public Tn pn { get { return fn; } }

    public override bool Equals (object __o) {…}
    public override int GetHashCode () {…}
}
```

where each *`Tx`* is the type of the corresponding expression *`ex`*. The expression used in a *member-declarator* shall have a type. Thus, it is a compile-time error for an expression in a *member-declarator* to be `null` or an anonymous function. It is also a compile-time error for the expression to have an unsafe type.

The names of an anonymous type and of the parameter to its `Equals` method are automatically generated by the compiler and cannot be referenced in program text.

Within the same program, two anonymous object initializers that specify a sequence of properties of the same names and compile-time types in the same order will produce instances of the same anonymous type.

[*Example*: In the example

```csharp
var p1 = new { Name = "Lawnmower", Price = 495.00 };
var p2 = new { Name = "Shovel", Price = 26.95 };
p1 = p2;
```

the assignment on the last line is permitted because `p1` and `p2` are of the same anonymous type. *end example*]

The `Equals` and `GetHashcode` methods on anonymous types override the methods inherited from `object`, and are defined in terms of the `Equals` and `GetHashcode` of the properties, so that two instances of the same anonymous type are equal if and only if all their properties are equal.

A member declarator can be abbreviated to a simple name (§12.7.3), a member access (§12.7.5) or a base access (§12.7.9). This is called a ***projection initializer*** and is shorthand for a declaration of and assignment to a property with the same name. Specifically, member declarators of the forms

```plaintext
identifier expr . identifier
```

are precisely equivalent to the following, respectively:

```plaintext
identifer = identifier identifier = expr . identifier
```

Thus, in a projection initializer the *identifier* selects both the value and the field or property to which the value is assigned. Intuitively, a projection initializer projects not just a value, but also the name of the value.

### The typeof operator

The `typeof` operator is used to obtain the `System.Type` object for a type.

```antlr
typeof-expression:
    typeof ( type )
    typeof ( unbound-type-name )
    typeof ( void )

unbound-type-name:
    identifier generic-dimension-specifieropt
    identifier :: identifier generic-dimension-specifieropt
    unbound-type-name . identifier generic-dimension-specifieropt

generic-dimension-specifier:
    < commasopt >

    commas:
    ,
    commas ,
```

The first form of *typeof-expression* consists of a `typeof` keyword followed by a parenthesized *type*. The result of an expression of this form is the `System.Type` object for the indicated type. There is only one `System.Type` object for any given type. This means that for a type `T`, `typeof(T) == typeof(T)` is always true. The *type* cannot be `dynamic`.

The second form of *typeof-expression* consists of a `typeof` keyword followed by a parenthesized *unbound-type-name*. 

> [!NOTE]
> An *unbound-type-name* is very similar to a *type-name* (§8.8) except that an *unbound-type-name* contains *generic-dimension-specifier*s where a *type-name* contains *type-argument-list*s. 

When the operand of a *typeof-expression* is a sequence of tokens that satisfies the grammars of both *unbound-type-name* and *type-name*, namely when it contains neither a *generic-dimension-specifier* nor a *type-argument-list*, the sequence of tokens is considered to be a *type-name*. The meaning of an *unbound-type-name* is determined as follows:

- Convert the sequence of tokens to a *type-name* by replacing each *generic-dimension-specifier* with a *type-argument-list* having the same number of commas and the keyword object as each *type-argument*.
- Evaluate the resulting *type-name*, while ignoring all type parameter constraints.
- The *unbound-type-name* resolves to the ***unbound generic type*** associated with the resulting constructed type (§9.4).

The result of the *typeof-expression* is the `System.Type` object for the resulting unbound generic type.

The third form of *typeof-expression* consists of a `typeof` keyword followed by a parenthesized `void` keyword. The result of an expression of this form is the `System.Type` object that represents the absence of a type. The type object returned by `typeof(void`) is distinct from the type object returned for any type. 

> [!NOTE]
> This special type object is useful in class libraries that allow reflection onto methods in the language, where those methods wish to have a way to represent the return type of any method, including void methods, with an instance of `System.Type`.

The `typeof` operator can be used on a type parameter. The result is the `System.Type` object for the run-time type that was bound to the type parameter. The `typeof` operator can also be used on a constructed type or an unbound generic type (§9.4.4). The `System.Type` object for an unbound generic type is not the same as the `System.Type` object of the instance type (§15.3.2). The instance type is always a closed constructed type at run-time so its `System.Type` object depends on the run-time type arguments in use. The unbound generic type, on the other hand, has no type arguments, and yields the same `System.Type` object regardless of runtime type arguments.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class X<T>
{
    public static void PrintTypes ()
    {
        Type[] t = {
            typeof (int),
            typeof (System.Int32),
            typeof (string),
            typeof (double[]),
            typeof (void),
            typeof (T),
            typeof (X<T>),
            typeof (X<X<T>>),
            typeof (X<>)
        };
        for (int i = 0; i < t.Length; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine (t[i]);
        }
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        X<int>.PrintTypes ();
    }
}
```

produces the following output:

```plaintext
System.Int32
System.Int32
System.String
System.Double[]
System.Void
System.Int32
X` 1[System.Int32]
X` 1[X` 1[System.Int32]]
X` 1[T]
```

Note that `int` and `System.Int32` are the same type.

The result of `typeof(X<>)` does not depend on the type argument but the result of `typeof(X<T>)` does. *end example*]

### The sizeof operator

The `sizeof` operator returns the number of 8-bit bytes occupied by a variable of a given type. The type specified as an operand to `sizeof` shall be an unmanaged-type (§23.3).

For certain predefined types the `sizeof` operator yields a constant `int` value as shown in the table below:

|  Expression      | Result |
|  ----------------| -------- |
|  sizeof(sbyte)   | 1 |
|  sizeof(byte)    | 1 |
|  sizeof(short)   | 2 |
|  sizeof(ushort)  | 2 |
|  sizeof(int)     | 4 |
|  sizeof(uint)    | 4 |
|  sizeof(long)    | 8 |
|  sizeof(ulong)   | 8 |
|  sizeof(char)    | 2 |
|  sizeof(float)   | 4 |
|  sizeof(double)  | 8 |
|  sizeof(bool)    | 1 |
|  sizeof(decimal) | 16 |

For an enum type `T`, the result of the expression `sizeof(T)` is a constant value equal to the size of its underlying type, as given above. For all other operand types, the `sizeof` operator is specified in §23.6.9.

### The checked and unchecked operators

The `checked` and `unchecked` operators are used to control the ***overflow-checking context*** for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.

checked-expression:
    checked ( expression )

unchecked-expression:
    unchecked ( expression )

The `checked` operator evaluates the contained expression in a `checked` context, and the `unchecked` operator evaluates the contained expression in an `unchecked` context. A *checked-expression* or *unchecked-expression* corresponds exactly to a *parenthesized-expression* (§12.7.4), except that the contained expression is evaluated in the given overflow checking context.

The overflow checking context can also be controlled through the `checked` and `unchecked` statements (§13.12).

The following operations are affected by the overflow checking context established by the `checked` and `unchecked` operators and statements:

- The predefined `++` and `--` operators (§12.7.10 and §12.8.6), when the operand is of an integral or enumtype.
- The predefined `-` unary operator (§12.8.3), when the operand is of an integral type.
- The predefined `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` binary operators (§12.9), when both operands are of integral or enumtypes.
- Explicit numeric conversions (§11.3.2) from one integral or enumtype to another integral or enumtype, or from `float` or `double` to an integral or enumtype.

When one of the above operations produces a result that is too large to represent in the destination type, the context in which the operation is performed controls the resulting behavior:

- In a `checked` context, if the operation is a constant expression (§12.20), a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, when the operation is performed at run-time, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.
- In an `unchecked` context, the result is truncated by discarding any high-order bits that do not fit in the destination type.

For non-constant expressions (§12.20) (expressions that are evaluated at run-time) that are not enclosed by any `checked` or `unchecked` operators or statements, the default overflow checking context is `unchecked`, unless external factors (such as compiler switches and execution environment configuration) call for `checked` evaluation.

For constant expressions (§12.20) (expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile-time), the default overflow checking context is always `checked`. Unless a constant expression is explicitly placed in an `unchecked` context, overflows that occur during the compile-time evaluation of the expression always cause compile-time errors.

The body of an anonymous function is not affected by `checked` or `unchecked` contexts in which the anonymous function occurs.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
    static readonly int x = 1000000;
    static readonly int y = 1000000;

    static int F ()
    {
        return checked (x * y); // Throws OverflowException
    }

    static int G ()
    {
        return unchecked (x * y); // Returns -727379968
    }

    static int H ()
    {
        return x * y; // Depends on default
    }
}
```

no compile-time errors are reported since neither of the expressions can be evaluated at compile-time. At run-time, the `F` method throws a `System.OverflowException`, and the `G` method returns –727379968 (the lower 32 bits of the out-of-range result). The behavior of the `H` method depends on the default overflow-checking context for the compilation, but it is either the same as `F` or the same as `G`. *end example*]

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
    const int x = 1000000;
    const int y = 1000000;

    static int F ()
    {
        return checked (x * y); // Compile-time error, overflow
    }

    static int G ()
    {
        return unchecked (x * y); // Returns -727379968
    }

    static int H ()
    {
        return x * y; // Compile-time error, overflow
    }
}
```

the overflows that occur when evaluating the constant expressions in `F` and `H` cause compile-time errors to be reported because the expressions are evaluated in a `checked` context. An overflow also occurs when evaluating the constant expression in `G`, but since the evaluation takes place in an `unchecked` context, the overflow is not reported. *end example*]

The `checked` and `unchecked` operators only affect the overflow checking context for those operations that are textually contained within the “`(`” and “`)`” tokens. The operators have no effect on function members that are invoked as a result of evaluating the contained expression. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
    static int Multiply (int x, int y)
    {
        return x * y;
    }

    static int F ()
    {
        return checked (Multiply (1000000, 1000000));
    }
}
```

the use of `checked` in `F` does not affect the evaluation of `x * y` in `Multiply`, so `x * y` is evaluated in the default overflow checking context. *end example*]

The `unchecked` operator is convenient when writing constants of the signed integral types in hexadecimal notation. [*Example*:

```csharp
class Test
{
    public const int AllBits = unchecked ((int) 0xFFFFFFFF);

    public const int HighBit = unchecked ((int) 0x80000000);
}
```

Both of the hexadecimal constants above are of type `uint`. Because the constants are outside the `int` range, without the `unchecked` operator, the casts to `int` would produce compile-time errors. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> The `checked` and `unchecked` operators and statements allow programmers to control certain aspects of some numeric calculations. However, the behavior of some numeric operators depends on their operands’ data types. For example, multiplying two decimals always results in an exception on overflow *even* within an explicitly `unchecked` construct. Similarly, multiplying two floats never results in an exception on overflow *even* within an explicitly checked construct. In addition, other operators are *never* affected by the mode of checking, whether default or explicit.

### Default value expressions

A default value expression is used to obtain the default value (§10.3) of a type. Typically a default value expression is used for type parameters, since it might not be known if the type parameter is a value type or a reference type. (No conversion exists from the `null` literal (§7.4.5.7) to a type parameter unless the type parameter is known to be a reference type (§9.2).)

```antlr
default-value-expression:
    default ( type )
```

If the *type* in a *default-value-expression* evaluates at run-time to a reference type, the result is `null` converted to that type. If the *type* in a *default-value-expression* evaluates at run-time to a value type, the result is the *value-type*’s default value (§9.3.3).

A *default-value-expression* is a constant expression (§12.20) if *type* is a reference type or a type parameter that is known to be a reference type (§9.2). In addition, a *default-value-expression* is a constant expression if the type is one of the following value types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, `bool`, or any enumeration type.

### Anonymous method expressions

An *anonymous-method-expression* is one of two ways of defining an anonymous function. These are further described in §12.16.

## Unary operators

### General

The `+`, `-`, `!`, `~`, `++`, `--`, `cast`, and `await` operators are called the unary operators.

```antlr
unary-expression:
    primary-expression
    + unary-expression
    - unary-expression
    ! unary-expression
    ~ unary-expression
    pre-increment-expression
    pre-decrement-expression
    cast-expression
    await-expression
```
If the operand of a *unary-expression* has the compile-time type `dynamic`, it is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the *unary-expression* is `dynamic`, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of the operand.

### Unary plus operator

For an operation of the form `+x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. The predefined unary plus operators are:

```csharp
int operator +(int x);
uint operator +(uint x);
long operator +(long x);
ulong operator +(ulong x);
float operator +(float x);
double operator +(double x);
decimal operator +(decimal x);
```

For each of these operators, the result is simply the value of the operand.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined unary plus operators defined above are also predefined.

### Unary minus operator

For an operation of the form `–x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. The predefined unary minus operators are:

- Integer negation:
  ```csharp
  int operator –(int x);
  long operator –(long x);
  ```
  The result is computed by subtracting `x` from zero. If the value of `x` is the smallest representable value of the operand type (−2^31^ for `int` or −2^63^ for `long`), then the mathematical negation of `x` is not representable within the operand type. If this occurs within a `checked` context, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown; if it occurs within an `unchecked` context, the result is the value of the operand and the overflow is not reported.
  
  If the operand of the negation operator is of type `uint`, it is converted to type `long`, and the type of the result is `long`. An exception is the rule that permits the `int` value −2147483648 (−2^31^) to be written as a `decimal` integer literal (§7.4.5.3).
  
  If the operand of the negation operator is of type `ulong`, a compile-time error occurs. An exception is the rule that permits the `long` value −9223372036854775808 (−2^63^) to be written as a `decimal` integer literal (§7.4.5.3)
- Floating-point negation:
  ```csharp
  float operator –(float x);
  double operator –(double x);
  ```
  The result is the value of `x` with its sign inverted. If `x` is `NaN`, the result is also `NaN`.
- Decimal negation:
  ```csharp
  decimal operator –(decimal x);
  ```
  The result is computed by subtracting `x` from zero. Decimal negation is equivalent to using the unary minus operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined unary minus operators defined above are also predefined.

### Logical negation operator

For an operation of the form `!x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. Only one predefined logical negation operator exists:

```csharp
bool operator !(bool x);
```

This operator computes the logical negation of the operand: If the operand is `true`, the result is `false`. If the operand is `false`, the result is `true`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined logical negation operator defined above are also predefined.

### Bitwise complement operator

For an operation of the form `~x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. The predefined bitwise complement operators are:

```csharp
int operator ~(int x);
uint operator ~(uint x);
long operator ~(long x);
ulong operator ~(ulong x);
```

For each of these operators, the result of the operation is the bitwise complement of `x`.

Every enumeration type `E` implicitly provides the following bitwise complement operator:

```csharp
E operator ~(E x);
```

The result of evaluating `~x`, where `x` is an expression of an enumeration type `E` with an underlying type `U`, is exactly the same as evaluating `(E)(~(U)x)`, except that the conversion to `E` is always performed as if in an `unchecked` context (§12.7.14).

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined bitwise complement operators defined above are also predefined.

### Prefix increment and decrement operators

```antlr
pre-increment-expression:
    ++ unary-expression

pre-decrement-expression:
    -- unary-expression
```

The operand of a prefix increment or decrement operation shall be an expression classified as a variable, a property access, or an indexer access. The result of the operation is a value of the same type as the operand.

If the operand of a prefix increment or decrement operation is a property or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have both a get and a set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

Unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. Predefined `++` and `--` operators exist for the following types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, and any enum type. The predefined `++` operators return the value produced by adding 1 to the operand, and the predefined `--` operators return the value produced by subtracting 1 from the operand. In a `checked` context, if the result of this addition or subtraction is outside the range of the result type and the result type is an integral type or enum type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.

There shall be an implicit conversion from the return type of the selected unary operator to the type of the *primary-expression*, otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a prefix increment or decrement operation of the form `++x` or `--x` consists of the following steps:

- If `x` is classified as a variable:
  - `x` is evaluated to produce the variable.
  - The value of `x` is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and the operator is invoked with this value as its argument.
  - The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `x`. The resulting value is stored in the location given by the evaluation of `x`.
  - and becomes the result of the operation.
- If `x` is classified as a property or indexer access:
  - The instance expression (if `x` is not static) and the argument list (if `x` is an indexer access) associated with `x` are evaluated, and the results are used in the subsequent get and set accessor invocations.
  - The get accessor of `x` is invoked.
  - The value returned by the get accessor is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and operator is invoked with this value as its argument.
  - The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `x`. The set accessor of `x` is invoked with this value as its value argument.
  - This value also becomes the result of the operation.

The `++` and `--` operators also support postfix notation (§12.7.10). Typically, the result of `x++` or `x--` is the value of `x` *before* the operation, whereas the result of `++x` or `‑‑x` is the value of `x` *after* the operation. In either case, `x` itself has the same value after the operation.

An operator `++` or operator `--` implementation can be invoked using either postfix or prefix notation. It is not possible to have separate operator implementations for the two notations.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined prefix increment and decrement operators defined above are also predefined.

### Cast expressions

A *cast-expression* is used to convert explicitly an expression to a given type.

```antlr
cast-expression:
    ( type ) unary-expression
```

A *cast-expression* of the form `(T)E`, where `T` is a *type* and `E` is a *unary-expression*, performs an explicit conversion (§11.3) of the value of `E` to type `T`. If no explicit conversion exists from `E` to `T`, a binding-time error occurs. Otherwise, the result is the value produced by the explicit conversion. The result is always classified as a value, even if `E` denotes a variable.

The grammar for a *cast-expression* leads to certain syntactic ambiguities. [*Example*: The expression `(x)–y` could either be interpreted as a *cast-expression* (a cast of `–y` to type `x`) or as an *additive-expression* combined with a *parenthesized-expression* (which computes the value `x – y`). *end example*]

To resolve *cast-expression* ambiguities, the following rule exists: A sequence of one or more *token*s (§7.4) enclosed in parentheses is considered the start of a *cast-expression* only if at least one of the following are true:

- The sequence of tokens is correct grammar for a *type*, but not for an *expression*.
- The sequence of tokens is correct grammar for a *type*, and the token immediately following the closing parentheses is the token “`~`”, the token “`!`”, the token “`(`”, an *identifier* (§7.4.3), a *literal* (§7.4.5), or any *keyword* (§7.4.4) except `as` and `is`.

The term “correct grammar” above means only that the sequence of tokens shall conform to the particular grammatical production. It specifically does not consider the actual meaning of any constituent identifiers. [*Example*: If `x` and `y` are identifiers, then `x.y` is correct grammar for a type, even if `x.y` doesn’t actually denote a type. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> From the disambiguation rule, it follows that, if `x` and `y` are identifiers, `(x)y`, `(x)(y)`, and `(x)(-y)` are *cast-expression*s, but `(x)-y` is not, even if `x` identifies a type. However, if `x` is a keyword that identifies a predefined type (such as `int`), then all four forms are *cast-expression*s (because such a keyword could not possibly be an expression by itself).

### Await expressions

#### General

The await operator is used to suspend evaluation of the enclosing async function until the asynchronous operation represented by the operand has completed.

```antlr
await-expression:
    await unary-expression
```

An *await-expression* is only allowed in the body of an `async` function (§15.15). Within the nearest enclosing async function, an *await-expression* shall not occur in these places:

- Inside a nested (non-async) anonymous function
- In a `catch` or `finally` block of a *try-statement*
- Inside the block of a *lock-statement*
- In an anonymous function conversion to an expression tree type (§11.7.3)
- In an unsafe context

> [!NOTE]
> An *await-expression* cannot occur in most places within a *query-expression*, because those are syntactically transformed to use non-async lambda expressions.

Inside an `async` function, `await` shall not be used as an *available-identifier* although the verbatim identifier `@await` may be used. There is therefore no syntactic ambiguity between await-expressions and various expressions involving identifiers. Outside of `async` functions, `await` acts as a normal identifier.

The operand of an *await-expression* is called the ***task***. It represents an asynchronous operation that may or may not be complete at the time the *await-expression* is evaluated. The purpose of the `await` operator is to suspend execution of the enclosing `async` function until the awaited task is complete, and then obtain its outcome.

#### Awaitable expressions

The task of an `await` expression is required to be ***awaitable***. An expression *`t`* is awaitable if one of the following holds:

- *`t`* is of compile-time type dynamic
- *`t`* has an accessible instance or extension method called GetAwaiter with no parameters and no type parameters, and a return type *`A`* for which all of the following hold:
  - *`A`* implements the interface `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.INotifyCompletion` (hereafter known as `INotifyCompletion` for brevity)
  - *`A`* has an accessible, readable instance property `IsCompleted` of type `bool`
  - *`A`* has an accessible instance method `GetResult` with no parameters and no type parameters

The purpose of the `GetAwaiter` method is to obtain an ***awaiter*** for the task. The type *`A`* is called the ***awaiter type*** for the `await` expression.

The purpose of the `IsCompleted` property is to determine if the task is already complete. If so, there is no need to suspend evaluation.

The purpose of the `INotifyCompletion.OnCompleted` method is to sign up a “continuation” to the task; i.e., a delegate (of type `System.Action`) that will be invoked once the task is complete.

The purpose of the `GetResult` method is to obtain the outcome of the task once it is complete. This outcome may be successful completion, possibly with a result value, or it may be an exception which is thrown by the `GetResult` method.

#### Classification of await expressions

The expression `await t` is classified the same way as the expression `(t).GetAwaiter().GetResult()`. Thus, if the return type of `GetResult` is void, the *await-expression* is classified as nothing. If it has a non-void return type *`T`*, the *await-expression* is classified as a value of type *`T`*.

#### Run-time evaluation of await expressions

At run-time, the expression `await t` is evaluated as follows:

- An awaiter *`a`* is obtained by evaluating the expression `(t).GetAwaiter()`.
- A `bool b` is obtained by evaluating the expression `(a).IsCompleted`.
- If *`b`* is `false` then evaluation depends on whether *`a`* implements the interface `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ICriticalNotifyCompletion` (hereafter known as `ICriticalNotifyCompletion` for brevity). This check is done at binding time; i.e., at run-time if *`a`* has the compile-time type `dynamic`, and at compile-time otherwise. Let *`r`* denote the resumption delegate (§15.15):
  - If *`a`* does not implement `ICriticalNotifyCompletion`, then the expression
    `((a) as INotifyCompletion).OnCompleted(r)` is evaluated.
  - If *`a`* does implement `ICriticalNotifyCompletion`, then the expression
    `((a) as ICriticalNotifyCompletion).UnsafeOnCompleted(r)` is evaluated.
  - Evaluation is then suspended, and control is returned to the current caller of the `async` function.
- Either immediately after (if *`b`* was `true`), or upon later invocation of the resumption delegate (if *`b`* was `false`), the expression `(a).GetResult()` is evaluated. If it returns a value, that value is the result of the *await-expression*. Otherwise, the result is nothing.

An awaiter’s implementation of the interface methods `INotifyCompletion.OnCompleted` and `ICriticalNotifyCompletion.UnsafeOnCompleted` should cause the delegate *`r`* to be invoked at most once. Otherwise, the behavior of the enclosing async function is undefined.

## Arithmetic operators

### General

The `*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, and `–` operators are called the arithmetic operators.

```antlr
multiplicative-expression:
unary-expression
multiplicative-expression * unary-expression
multiplicative-expression / unary-expression
multiplicative-expression % unary-expression

additive-expression:
multiplicative-expression
additive-expression + multiplicative-expression
additive-expression – multiplicative-expression
```

If an operand of an arithmetic operator has the compile-time type `dynamic`, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the expression is `dynamic`, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type `dynamic`.

### Multiplication operator

For an operation of the form `x * y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined multiplication operators are listed below. The operators all compute the product of `x` and `y`.

- Integer multiplication:
  ```csharp
int operator *(int x, int y);
uint operator *(uint x, uint y);
long operator *(long x, long y);
ulong operator *(ulong x, ulong y);
  ```
  In a `checked` context, if the product is outside the range of the result type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. In an `unchecked` context, overflows are not reported and any significant high-order bits outside the range of the result type are discarded.
- Floating-point multiplication:
  ```csharp
  float operator *(float x, float y);
  double operator *(double x, double y);
  ```

  The product is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and `NaN`’s. In the table, `x` and `y` are positive finite values. `z` is the result of `x * y`, rounded to the nearest representable value. If the magnitude of the result is too large for the destination type, `z` is infinity. Because of rounding, `z` may be zero even though neither `x` nor `y` is zero.
  
  |       |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |
  |  -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| ----- |
  |       | +y   | –y   | +0   | –0   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  +x   | +z   | –z   | +0   | –0   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  –x   | –z   | +z   | –0   | +0   | –∞   | +∞   | NaN   |
  |  +0   | +0   | –0   | +0   | –0   | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |
  |  –0   | –0   | +0   | –0   | +0   | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |
  |  +∞   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN  | NaN  | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  –∞   | –∞   | +∞   | NaN  | NaN  | –∞   | +∞   | NaN   |
  |  NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |
  
  (Except were otherwise noted, in the floating-point tables in §12.9.2–§12.9.6 the use of “`+`” means the value is positive; the use of “`-`” means the value is negative; and the lack of a sign means the value may be positive or negative or has no sign (`NaN`).)
- Decimal multiplication:
  ```csharp
  decimal operator *(decimal x, decimal y);
  ```
  If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the `decimal` format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. Because of rounding, the result may be zero even though neither operand is zero. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the sum of the scales of the two operands.
 
  Decimal multiplication is equivalent to using the multiplication operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined multiplication operators defined above are also predefined.

### Division operator

For an operation of the form `x / y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined division operators are listed below. The operators all compute the quotient of `x` and `y`.

- Integer division:
  ```csharp
  int operator /(int x, int y);
  uint operator /(uint x, uint y);
  long operator /(long x, long y);
  ulong operator /(ulong x, ulong y);
  ```
  If the value of the right operand is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown.
 
  The division rounds the result towards zero. Thus the absolute value of the result is the largest possible integer that is less than or  qual to the absolute value of the quotient of the two operands. The result is zero or positive when the two operands have the same sign and  ero or negative when the two operands have opposite signs.
 
  If the left operand is the smallest representable `int` or `long` value and the right operand is `–1`, an overflow occurs. In a `checked` context, this causes a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) to be thrown. In an `unchecked` context, it is implementation-defined as to whether a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) is thrown or the overflow goes unreported with the resulting value being that of the left operand.
- Floating-point division:
  ```csharp
  float operator /(float x, float y);
  double operator /(double x, double y);
  ```
  The quotient is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaN’s. In the table, `x` and `y` are positive finite values. `z` is the result of `x / y`, rounded to the nearest representable value.

|       |      |      |     |      |      |      |       |
|  -----| -----| -----| ----| -----| -----| -----| ----- |
|       | +y   | –y   | 0   | –0   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN |
|  +x   | +z   | –z   | ∞   | –∞   | +0   | –0   | NaN |
|  –x   | –z   | +z   | ∞   | +∞   | –0   | +0   | NaN |
|  +0   | +0   | –0   | NaN  | NaN  | +0   | –0   | NaN |
|  –0   | –0   | +0   | NaN  | NaN  | –0   | +0   | NaN |
|  +∞   | +∞   | –∞   | ∞   | –∞   | NaN  | NaN  | NaN |
|  –∞   | –∞   | +∞   | ∞   | +∞   | NaN  | NaN  | NaN |
|  NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN |  NaN |  NaN |  NaN |  NaN |
  
- Decimal division:
  ```csharp
  decimal operator /(decimal x, decimal y);
  ```
  If the value of the right operand is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown. If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the `decimal` format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. Because of rounding, the result may be zero even though the first operand is not zero. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the closest scale to the preferred scale that will preserve a result equal to the exact result. The preferred scale is the scale of `x` less the scale of `y`.
 
  Decimal division is equivalent to using the division operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined division operators defined above are also predefined.

### Remainder operator

For an operation of the form `x % y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined remainder operators are listed below. The operators all compute the remainder of the division between `x` and `y`.

- Integer remainder:
  ```csharp
  int operator %(int x, int y);
  uint operator %(uint x, uint y);
  long operator %(long x, long y);
  ulong operator %(ulong x, ulong y);
  ```
  The result of `x % y` is the value produced by `x – (x / y) * y`. If y is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown.
  
  If the left operand is the smallest `int` or `long` value and the right operand is `–1`, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown if and only if `x / y` would throw an exception.
- Floating-point remainder:
  ```csharp
  float operator %(float x, float y);
  double operator %(double x, double y);
  ```
  The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaN’s. In the table, `x` and `y` are positive finite values. `z` is the result of `x % y` and is computed as `x – n * y`, where `n` is the largest possible integer that is less than or equal to `x / y`. This method of computing the remainder is analogous to that used for integer operands, but differs from the IEC 60559 definition (in which `n` is the integer closest to `x / y`).

  |       |      |      |      |      |      |      |       |
  |  -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| ----- |
  |       | +y   | –y   | +0   | –0   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  +x   | +z   | +z   | NaN  | NaN  | +x   | +x   | NaN   |
  |  –x   | –z   | –z   | NaN  | NaN  | –x   | –x   | NaN   |
  |  +0   | +0   | +0   | NaN  | NaN  | +0   | +0   | NaN   |
  |  –0   | –0   | –0   | NaN  | NaN  | –0   | –0   | NaN   |
  |  +∞   | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |
  |  –∞   | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |
  |  NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |
- Decimal remainder:
  ```csharp
  decimal operator %(decimal x, decimal y);
  ```
  If the value of the right operand is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown. It is implementation-defined when a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) is thrown. A conforming implementation shall not throw an exception for` x % y` in any case where `x / y` does not throw an exception. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the larger of the scales of the two operands, and the sign of the result, if non-zero, is the same as that of `x`.

Decimal remainder is equivalent to using the remainder operator of type `System.Decimal`.

> [!NOTE]
> These rules ensure that for all types, the result never has the opposite sign of the left operand.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined remainder operators defined above are also predefined.

### Addition operator

For an operation of the form `x + y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined addition operators are listed below. For numeric and enumeration types, the predefined addition operators compute the sum of the two operands. When one or both operands are of type `string`, the predefined addition operators concatenate the string representation of the operands.

- Integer addition:
  ```csharp
  int operator +(int x, int y);
  uint operator +(uint x, uint y);
  long operator +(long x, long y);
  ulong operator +(ulong x, ulong y
  ```
  In a `checked` context, if the sum is outside the range of the result type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. In an `unchecked` context, overflows are not reported and any significant high-order bits outside the range of the result type are discarded.
- Floating-point addition:
  ```csharp
  float operator +(float x, float y);
  double operator +(double x, double y);
  ```
  The sum is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaN’s. In the table, `x` and `y` are nonzero finite values, and `z` is the result of `x + y`,. If `x` and `y` have the same magnitude but opposite signs, `z` is positive zero. If `x + y` is too large to represent in the destination type, `z` is an infinity with the same sign as `x + y`.
  
  |       |      |      |      |      |      |       |
  |  -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| ----- |
  |       | y    | +0   | –0   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  x    | z    | x    | x    | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  +0   | y    | +0   | +0   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  –0   | y    | +0   | –0   | +∞   | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  +∞   | +∞   | +∞   | +∞   | +∞   | NaN  | NaN   |
  |  –∞   | –∞   | –∞   | –∞   | NaN  | –∞   | NaN   |
  |  NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |
- Decimal addition:
  ```csharp
  decimal operator +(decimal x, decimal y);
  ```
  If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the decimal format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the larger of the scales of the two operands.
  
  Decimal addition is equivalent to using the addition operator of type `System.Decimal`.
- Enumeration addition. Every enumeration type implicitly provides the following predefined operators, where `E` is the enum type, and `U` is the underlying type of `E`:
  ```csharp
  E operator +(E x, U y);
  E operator +(U x, E y);
  ```
  At run-time these operators are evaluated exactly as `(E)((U)x + (U)y)`.
- String concatenation:
  ```csharp
  string operator +(string x, string y);
  string operator +(string x, object y);
  string operator +(object x, string y);
  ```
  These overloads of the binary `+` operator perform string concatenation. If an operand of string concatenation is `null`, an empty string is substituted. Otherwise, any non-string operand is converted to its string representation by invoking the virtual `ToString` method inherited from type `object`. If `ToString` returns `null`, an empty string is substituted. [*Example*:
  ```csharp
  using System;
  
  class Test
  {
      static void Main()
      {
          string s = null;
          Console.WriteLine ("s = >" + s + "<"); // displays s = ><
          int i = 1;
          Console.WriteLine ("i = " + i); // displays i = 1
          float f = 1.2300E+15F;
          Console.WriteLine ("f = " + f); // displays f = 1.23E+15
          decimal d = 2.900m;
          Console.WriteLine ("d = " + d); // displays d = 2.900
      }
  }
  ```
  The output shown in the comments is the typical result on a US-English system. The precise output might depend on the regional settings of the execution environment. The string-concatenation operator itself behaves the same way in each case, but the ToString methods implicitly called during execution might be affected by regional settings. *end example*]
  
  The result of the string concatenation operator is a string that consists of the characters of the left operand followed by the characters of the right operand. The string concatenation operator never returns a `null` value. A `System.OutOfMemoryException` may be thrown if there is not enough memory available to allocate the resulting string.
- Delegate combination. Every delegate type implicitly provides the following predefined operator, where `D` is the delegate type:
  ```csharp
  D operator +(D x, D y);
  ```
  If the first operand is `null`, the result of the operation is the value of the second operand (even if that is also `null`). Otherwise, if the second operand is `null`, then the result of the operation is the value of the first operand. Otherwise, the result of the operation is a new delegate instance whose invocation list consists of the elements in the invocation list of the first operand, followed by the elements in the invocation list of the second operand. That is, the invocation list of the resulting delegate is the concatenation of the invocation lists of the two operands. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > For examples of delegate combination, see §12.9.6 and §20.6. Since `System.Delegate` is not a delegate type, operator `+` is not defined for it.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined addition operators defined above are also predefined.

### Subtraction operator

For an operation of the form `x – y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined subtraction operators are listed below. The operators all subtract `y` from `x`.

- Integer subtraction:
  ```csharp
  int operator –(int x, int y);
  uint operator –(uint x, uint y);
  long operator –(long x, long y);
  ulong operator –(ulong x, ulong y
  ```
  In a `checked` context, if the difference is outside the range of the result type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. In an `unchecked` context, overflows are not reported and any significant high-order bits outside the range of the result type are discarded.
- Floating-point subtraction:
  ```csharp
  float operator –(float x, float y);
  double operator –(double x, double y);
  ```
  The difference is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaNs. In the table, `x` and `y` are nonzero finite values, and `z` is the result of `x – y`. If `x` and `y` are equal, `z` is positive zero. If `x – y` is too large to represent in the destination type, `z` is an infinity with the same sign as `x – y`.

  |       |      |      |      |      |       |      |
  |  -----| -----| -----| -----| -----| ----- |----- |
  |       | y    | +0   | –0   | +∞   | –∞    |NaN   |
  |  x    | z    | x    | x    | –∞   | +∞    |NaN   |
  |  +0   | –y   | +0   | +0   | –∞   | +∞    |NaN   |
  |  –0   | –y   | –0   | +0   | –∞   | +∞    |NaN   |
  |  +∞   | +∞   | +∞   | +∞   | NaN  | +∞    |NaN   |
  |  –∞   | –∞   | –∞   | –∞   | –∞   | NaN   |NaN   |
  |  NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN  | NaN   |NaN   |
  
  (In the above table the `-y` entries denote the *negation* of `y`, not that the value is negative.)
- Decimal subtraction:
  ```csharp
  decimal operator –(decimal x, decimal y);
  ```
  If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the decimal format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the larger of the scales of the two operands.
  
  Decimal subtraction is equivalent to using the subtraction operator of type `System.Decimal`.
- Enumeration subtraction. Every enumeration type implicitly provides the following predefined operator, where `E` is the enum type, and `U` is the underlying type of `E`:
  ```csharp
  U operator –(E x, E y);
  ```
  This operator is evaluated exactly as `(U)((U)x – (U)y)`. In other words, the operator computes the difference between the ordinal values of `x` and `y`, and the type of the result is the underlying type of the enumeration.
  ```csharp
  E operator –(E x, U y);
  ```
  This operator is evaluated exactly as `(E)((U)x – y)`. In other words, the operator subtracts a value from the underlying type of the enumeration, yielding a value of the enumeration.
- Delegate removal. Every delegate type implicitly provides the following predefined operator, where `D` is the delegate type:
  ```csharp
  D operator –(D x, D y);
  ```
  If the first operand is `null`, the result of the operation is `null`. Otherwise, if the second operand is `null`, then the result of the operation is the value of the first operand. Otherwise, both operands represent invocation lists (§20.2) having one or more entries, and the result is a new invocation list consisting of the first operand’s list with the second operand’s entries removed from it, provided the second operand’s list is a proper contiguous sublist of the first’s. (To determine sublist equality, corresponding entries are compared as for the delegate equality operator (§12.11.9).) Otherwise, the result is the value of the left operand. Neither of the operands’ lists is changed in the process. If the second operand’s list matches multiple sublists of contiguous entries in the first operand’s list, the right-most matching sublist of contiguous entries is removed. If removal results in an empty list, the result is `null`. [*Example*:
  ```csharp
  delegate void D (int x);
  class C
  {
      public static void M1 (int i) { / \ * …\ * / }
      public static void M2 (int i) { / \ * …\ * / }
  }
  
  class Test
  {
      static void Main()
      {
          D cd1 = new D (C.M1);
          D cd2 = new D (C.M2);
  
          D cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
          cd3 -= cd1; // => M1 + M2 + M2
  
          cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
          cd3 -= cd1 + cd2; // => M2 + M1
  
          cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
          cd3 -= cd2 + cd2; // => M1 + M1
  
          cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
          cd3 -= cd2 + cd1; // => M1 + M2
  
          cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
          cd3 -= cd1 + cd1; // => M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
      }
  }
  ```
  *end example*]

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined subtraction operators defined above are also predefined.

## Shift operators

The `<<` and `>>` operators are used to perform bit-shifting operations.

```antlr
shift-expression:
    additive-expression
    shift-expression << additive-expression
    shift-expression right-shift additive-expression
```

If an operand of a *shift-expression* has the compile-time type `dynamic`, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the expression is `dynamic`, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type `dynamic`.

For an operation of the form `x << count` or `x >> count`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

When declaring an overloaded shift operator, the type of the first operand shall always be the class or struct containing the operator declaration, and the type of the second operand shall always be `int`.

The predefined shift operators are listed below.

- Shift left:
  ```csharp
  int operator <<(int x, int count);
  uint operator <<(uint x, int count);
  long operator <<(long x, int count);
  ulong operator <<(ulong x, int count);
  ```
  The `<<` operator shifts `x` left by a number of bits computed as described below.
 
  The high-order bits outside the range of the result type of `x` are discarded, the remaining bits are shifted left, and the low-order empty bit positions are set to zero.
- Shift right:
  ```csharp
  int operator >>(int x, int count);
  uint operator >>(uint x, int count);
  long operator >>(long x, int count);
  ulong operator >>(ulong x, int count);
  ```
  The `>>` operator shifts `x` right by a number of bits computed as described below.
  
  When `x` is of type `int` or `long`, the low-order bits of `x` are discarded, the remaining bits are shifted right, and the high-order empty bit positions are set to zero if `x` is non-negative and set  to one if `x` is negative.
  
  When `x` is of type `uint` or `ulong`, the low-order bits of `x` are discarded, the remaining bits are shifted right, and the high-order empty bit positions are set to zero.

For the predefined operators, the number of bits to shift is computed as follows:

- When the type of `x` is `int` or `uint`, the shift count is given by the low-order five bits of count. In other words, the shift count is computed from `count & 0x1F`.
- When the type of `x` is `long` or `ulong`, the shift count is given by the low-order six bits of count. In other words, the shift count is computed from `count & 0x3F`.

If the resulting shift count is zero, the shift operators simply return the value of `x`.

Shift operations never cause overflows and produce the same results in `checked` and `unchecked` contexts.

When the left operand of the `>>` operator is of a signed integral type, the operator performs an *arithmetic* shift right wherein the value of the most significant bit (the sign bit) of the operand is propagated to the high-order empty bit positions. When the left operand of the `>>` operator is of an unsigned integral type, the operator performs a *logical* shift right wherein high-order empty bit positions are always set to zero. To perform the opposite operation of that inferred from the operand type, explicit casts can be used. [*Example*: If `x` is a variable of type `int`, the operation `unchecked((int)((uint)x >> y))` performs a logical shift right of `x`. *end example*]

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined shift operators defined above are also predefined.

## Relational and type-testing operators

### General

The `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `is`, and `as` operators are called the relational and type-testing operators.

```antlr
relational-expression:
    shift-expression
    relational-expression < shift-expression
    relational-expression > shift-expression
    relational-expression <= shift-expression
    relational-expression >= shift-expression
    relational-expression is type
    relational-expression as type

equality-expression:
    relational-expression
    equality-expression == relational-expression
    equality-expression != relational-expression
```
The `is` operator is described in §12.11.11 and the `as` operator is described in §12.11.12.

The `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=` operators are ***comparison operators***.

If an operand of a comparison operator has the compile-time type `dynamic`, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case the compile-time type of the expression is `dynamic`, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type `dynamic`.

For an operation of the form `x *op* y`, where *op* is a comparison operator, overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. If both operands of an *equality-expression* are the `null` literal, then overload resolution is not performed and the expression evaluates to a constant value of `true` or `false` according to whether the operator is `==` or `!=`.

The predefined comparison operators are described in the following subclauses. All predefined comparison operators return a result of type `bool`, as described in the following table.

|  **Operation**  | **Result**                                               |
|  ---------------| -------------------------------------------------------- |
|  x == y         | true if x is equal to y, false otherwise                 |
|  x != y         | true if x is not equal to y, false otherwise             |
|  x < y          | true if x is less than y, false otherwise                |
|  x > y          | true if x is greater than y, false otherwise             |
|  x <= y         | true if x is less than or equal to y, false otherwise    |
|  x >= y         | true if x is greater than or equal to y, false otherwise |

### Integer comparison operators

The predefined integer comparison operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(int x, int y);
bool operator ==(uint x, uint y);
bool operator ==(long x, long y);
bool operator ==(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator !=(int x, int y);
bool operator !=(uint x, uint y);
bool operator !=(long x, long y);
bool operator !=(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator <(int x, int y);
bool operator <(uint x, uint y);
bool operator <(long x, long y);
bool operator <(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator >(int x, int y);
bool operator >(uint x, uint y);
bool operator >(long x, long y);
bool operator >(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator <=(int x, int y);
bool operator <=(uint x, uint y);
bool operator <=(long x, long y);
bool operator <=(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator >=(int x, int y);
bool operator >=(uint x, uint y);
bool operator >=(long x, long y);
bool operator >=(ulong x, ulong y);
```

Each of these operators compares the numeric values of the two integer operands and returns a `bool` value that indicates whether the particular relation is `true` or `false`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined integer comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Floating-point comparison operators

The predefined floating-point comparison operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(float x, float y);
bool operator ==(double x, double y);

bool operator !=(float x, float y);
bool operator !=(double x, double y);

bool operator <(float x, float y);
bool operator <(double x, double y);

bool operator >(float x, float y);
bool operator >(double x, double y);

bool operator <=(float x, float y);
bool operator <=(double x, double y);

bool operator >=(float x, float y);
bool operator >=(double x, double y);
```

The operators compare the operands according to the rules of the IEC 60559 standard:

If either operand is `NaN`, the result is `false` for all operators except `!=`, for which the result is `true`. For any two operands, `x != y` always produces the same result as `!(x == y)`. However, when one or both operands are `NaN`, the `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators do *not* produce the same results as the logical negation of the opposite operator. [*Example*: If either of `x` and `y` is `NaN`, then `x < y` is `false`, but `!(x >= y)` is `true`. *end example*]

- When neither operand is `NaN`, the operators compare the values of the two floating-point operands with respect to the ordering
  ```plaintext
  –∞ < –max < … < –min < –0.0 == +0.0 < +min < … < +max < +∞
  ```
  where min and max are the smallest and largest positive finite values that can be represented in the given floating-point format. Notable effects of this ordering are:
  - Negative and positive zeros are considered equal.
  - A negative infinity is considered less than all other values, but equal to another negative infinity.
  - A positive infinity is considered greater than all other values, but equal to another positive infinity.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined floating-point comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Decimal comparison operators

The predefined decimal comparison operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator !=(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator <(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator >(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator <=(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator >=(decimal x, decimal y);
```

Each of these operators compares the numeric values of the two decimal operands and returns a bool value that indicates whether the particular relation is `true` or `false`. Each decimal comparison is equivalent to using the corresponding relational or equality operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined decimal comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Boolean equality operators

The predefined Boolean equality operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(bool x, bool y);
bool operator !=(bool x, bool y);
```

The result of `==` is `true` if both `x` and `y` are `true` or if both `x` and `y` are `false`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.

The result of `!=` is `false` if both `x` and `y` are `true` or if both `x` and `y` are `false`. Otherwise, the result is `true`. When the operands are of type `bool`, the `!=` operator produces the same result as the `^` operator.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined Boolean equality operators defined above are also predefined.

### Enumeration comparison operators

Every enumeration type implicitly provides the following predefined comparison operators

```csharp
bool operator ==(E x, E y);
bool operator !=(E x, E y);

bool operator <(E x, E y);
bool operator >(E x, E y);
bool operator <=(E x, E y);
bool operator >=(E x, E y);
```

The result of evaluating `x *op* y`, where `x` and `y` are expressions of an enumeration type `E` with an underlying type `U`, and *op* is one of the comparison operators, is exactly the same as evaluating `((U)x) *op *((U)y)`. In other words, the enumeration type comparison operators simply compare the underlying integral values of the two operands.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined enumeration comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Reference type equality operators

Every class type C implicitly provides the following predefined reference type equality operators:

```csharp
bool operator ==(C x, C y);

bool operator !=(C x, C y);
```

unless predefined equality operators otherwise exist for `C` (for example, when `C` is `string` or `System.Delegate`).

The operators return the result of comparing the two references for equality or non-equality. operator `==` returns `true` if and only if `x` and `y` refer to the same instance or are both `null`, while operator `!=` returns `true` if and only if operator `==` with the same operands would return `false`.

In addition to normal applicability rules (§12.6.4.2), the predefined reference type equality operators require one of the following in order to be applicable:

- Both operands are a value of a type known to be a *reference-type* or the literal `null`. Furthermore, an explicit identity or reference conversion (§11.3.5) exists from either operand to the type of the other operand.
- One operand is the literal `null`, and the other operand is a value of type `T` where `T` is a *type-parameter* that is not known to be a value type, and does not have the value type constraint.
  - If at runtime `T` is a non-nullable value type, the result of `==` is `false` and the result of `!=` is `true`.
  - If at runtime `T` is a nullable value type, the result is computed from the `HasValue` property of the operand, as described in (§12.11.10).
  - If at runtime `T` is a reference type, the result is `true` if the operand is `null`, and `false` otherwise.

Unless one of these conditions is true, a binding-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> Notable implications of these rules are:
> 
> - It is a binding-time error to use the predefined reference type equality operators to compare two references that are known to be different at binding-time. For example, if the binding-time types of the operands are two class types, and if neither derives from the other, then it would be impossible for the two operands to reference the same object. Thus, the operation is considered a binding-time error.
> - The predefined reference type equality operators do not permit value type operands to be compared (except when type parameters are compared to null, which is handled specially).
> - Operands of predefined reference type equality operators are never boxed. It would be meaningless to perform such boxing operations, since references to the newly allocated boxed instances would necessarily differ from all other references.
> 
> For an operation of the form `x == y` or `x != y`, if any applicable user-defined operator `==` or operator `!=` exists, the operator overload resolution rules (§12.4.5) will select that operator instead of the predefined reference type equality operator. It is always possible to select the predefined reference type equality operator by explicitly casting one or both of the operands to type object.

[*Example*: The following example checks whether an argument of an unconstrained type parameter type is `null`.

```csharp
class C<T>
{
    void F (T x)
    {
        if (x == null) throw new ArgumentNullException ();
        …
    }
}
```
The `x == null` construct is permitted even though `T` could represent a non-nullable value type, and the result is simply defined to be `false` when `T` is a non-nullable value type. *end example*]

For an operation of the form `x == y` or `x != y`, if any applicable operator `==` or operator `!=` exists, the operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) rules will select that operator instead of the predefined reference type equality operator. 
> [!NOTE]
> It is always possible to select the predefined reference type equality operator by explicitly casting both of the operands to type `object`.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string s = "Test";
        string t = string.Copy (s);
        Console.WriteLine (s == t);
        Console.WriteLine ((object) s == t);
        Console.WriteLine (s == (object) t);
        Console.WriteLine ((object) s == (object) t);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
True
False
False
False
```

The `s` and `t` variables refer to two distinct string instances containing the same characters. The first comparison outputs True because the predefined string equality operator (§12.11.8) is selected when both operands are of type `string`. The remaining comparisons all output `False` because the overload of `operator==` in the `string` type is not applicable when either operand has a binding-time type of object.

Note that the above technique is not meaningful for value types. The example

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 123;
        int j = 123;
        System.Console.WriteLine ((object) i == (object) j);
    }
}
```

outputs `False` because the casts create references to two separate instances of boxed `int` values. *end example*]

### String equality operators

The predefined string equality operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(string x, string y);
bool operator !=(string x, string y);
```

Two string values are considered equal when one of the following is true:

- Both values are `null`.
- Both values are non-null references to string instances that have identical lengths and identical characters in each character position.

The string equality operators compare string values rather than string references. When two separate string instances contain the exact same sequence of characters, the values of the strings are equal, but the references are different. 
> [!NOTE]
> As described in §12.11.7, the reference type equality operators can be used to compare string references instead of string values.

### Delegate equality operators

The predefined delegate equality operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(System.Delegate x, System.Delegate y);

bool operator !=(System.Delegate x, System.Delegate y);
```

Two delegate instances are considered equal as follows:

- If either of the delegate instances is `null`, they are equal if and only if both are `null`.
- If the delegates have different run-time type, they are never equal.
- If both of the delegate instances have an invocation list (§20.2), those instances are equal if and only if their invocation lists are the same length, and each entry in one’s invocation list is equal (as defined below) to the corresponding entry, in order, in the other’s invocation list.

The following rules govern the equality of invocation list entries:

- If two invocation list entries both refer to the same static method then the entries are equal.
- If two invocation list entries both refer to the same non-static method on the same target object (as defined by the reference equality operators) then the entries are equal.
- Invocation list entries produced from evaluation of semantically identical anonymous functions (§12.16) with the same (possibly empty) set of captured outer variable instances are permitted (but not required) to be equal.

If operator overload resolution resolves to either delegate equality operator, and the binding-time types of both operands are delegate types as described in §20 rather than `System.Delegate`, and there is no identity conversion between the binding-type operand types, a binding-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule prevents comparisons which can never consider non-null values as equal due to being references to instances of different types of delegates.

### Equality operators between nullable value types and the null literal

The `==` and `!=` operators permit one operand to be a value of a nullable value type and the other to be the `null` literal, even if no predefined or user-defined operator (in unlifted or lifted form) exists for the operation.

For an operation of one of the forms

```csharp
x == null null == x x != null null != x
```

where `x` is an expression of a nullable value type, if operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) fails to find an applicable operator, the result is instead computed from the `HasValue` property of `x`. Specifically, the first two forms are translated into `!x.HasValue`, and the last two forms are translated into `x.HasValue`.

### The is operator

The `is` operator is used to check if the run-time type of an object is compatible with a given type. The check is performed at runtime. The result of the operation `E` is `T`, where `E` is an expression and `T` is a type other than dynamic, is a `Boolean` value indicating whether `E` is non-null and can successfully be converted to type `T` by a reference conversion, a boxing conversion, an unboxing conversion, a wrapping conversion, or an unwrapping conversion.

The operation is evaluated as follows:

- If `E` is an anonymous function, a compile-time error occurs
- If `E` is a method group or the `null` literal, of if the value of `E` is `null`, the result is `false`.
- Otherwise:
  - Let `R` be the runtime type of `E`.
  - Let `D` be derived from `R` as follows:
    - If `R` is a nullable value type, `D` is the underlying type of `R`.
    - Otherwise, `D` is `R`.

The result depends on `D` and `T` as follows:
- If `T` is a reference type, the result is `true` if:
  - `D` and `T` are the same type,
  - `D` is a reference type and an implicit reference conversion from `D` to `T` exists, or
    - Either: `D` is a value type and a boxing conversion from `D` to `T` exists.
    - Or: `D` is a value type and `T` is an interface type implemented by `D`.
- If `T` is a nullable value type, the result is `true` if `D` is the underlying type of `T`.
- If `T` is a non-nullable value type, the result is `true` if `D` and `T` are the same type.
- Otherwise, the result is `false`.

User defined conversions are not considered by the is operator.

> [!NOTE]
> As the `is` operator is evaluated at runtime, all type arguments have been substituted and there are no open types (§9.4.3) to consider.

> [!NOTE]
> The is operator can be understood in terms of compile-time types and conversions as follows, where `C` is the compile-time type of `E`:
>  
> - If the compile-time type of `e` is the same as `T`, or if an implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7), boxing conversion (§11.2.8), wrapping conversion (§11.6), or an explicit unwrapping conversion (§11.6) exists from the compile-time type of `E` to `T`:
>   - If `C` is of a non-nullable value type, the result of the operation is `true`.
>   - Otherwise, the result of the operation is equivalent to evaluating `E != null`.
> - Otherwise, if an explicit reference conversion (§11.3.5) or unboxing conversion (§11.3.6) exists from `C` to `T`, or if `C` or `T` is an open type (§9.4.3), then runtime checks as above must be peformed.
> - Otherwise, no reference, boxing, wrapping, or unwrapping conversion of `E` to type `T` is possible, and the result of the operation is `false`.
>  
> A compiler may implement optimisations based on the compile-time type.

### The as operator

The `as` operator is used to explicitly convert a value to a given reference type or nullable value type. Unlike a cast expression (§12.8.7), the as operator never throws an exception. Instead, if the indicated conversion is not possible, the resulting value is `null`.

In an operation of the form `E as T`, `E` shall be an expression and `T` shall be a reference type, a type parameter known to be a reference type, or a nullable value type. Furthermore, at least one of the following shall be true, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs:

- An identity (§11.2.2), implicit nullable (§11.2.5), implicit reference (§11.2.7), boxing (§11.2.8), explicit nullable (§11.3.4), explicit reference (§11.3.5), or wrapping (§9.3.11) conversion exists from `E` to `T`.
- The type of `E` or `T` is an open type.
- `E` is the `null` literal.

If the compile-time type of `E` is not dynamic, the operation `E` as `T` produces the same result as

```csharp
E is T ? (T)(E) : (T)null
```

except that `E` is only evaluated once. The compiler can be expected to optimize `E as T` to perform at most one runtime type check as opposed to the two runtime type checks implied by the expansion above.

If the compile-time type of `E` is `dynamic`, unlike the `cast` operator the `as` operator is not dynamically bound (§12.3.3). Therefore the expansion in this case is:

```csharp
E is T ? (T)(object)(E) : (T)null
```

Note that some conversions, such as user defined conversions, are not possible with the `as` operator and should instead be performed using cast expressions.

[*Example*: In the example

```csharp
class X
{

    public string F (object o)
    {
        return o as string; // OK, string is a reference type
    }

    public T G<T> (object o) where T : Attribute
    {
        return o as T; // Ok, T has a class constraint
    }

    public U H<U> (object o)
    {
        return o as U; // Error, U is unconstrained
    }
}
```

the type parameter `T` of `G` is known to be a reference type, because it has the class constraint. The type parameter `U` of `H` is not however; hence the use of the `as` operator in `H` is disallowed. *end example*]

##  Logical operators

### General

The `&`, `^`, and `|` operators are called the logical operators.

```antlr
and-expression:
    equality-expression
    and-expression & equality-expression

exclusive-or-expression:
    and-expression
    exclusive-or-expression ^ and-expression

inclusive-or-expression:
    exclusive-or-expression
    inclusive-or-expression | exclusive-or-expression
```

If an operand of a logical operator has the compile-time type `dynamic`, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case the compile-time type of the expression is `dynamic`, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type `dynamic`.

For an operation of the form `x *op *y`, where *op* is one of the logical operators, overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined logical operators are described in the following subclauses.

### Integer logical operators

The predefined integer logical operators are:

```csharp
int operator &(int x, int y);
uint operator &(uint x, uint y);
long operator &(long x, long y);
ulong operator &(ulong x, ulong y);

int operator |(int x, int y);
uint operator |(uint x, uint y);
long operator |(long x, long y);
ulong operator |(ulong x, ulong y);

int operator ^(int x, int y);
uint operator ^(uint x, uint y);
long operator ^(long x, long y);
ulong operator ^(ulong x, ulong y);
```

The `&` operator computes the bitwise logical `AND` of the two operands, the `|` operator computes the bitwise logical `OR` of the two operands, and the `^` operator computes the bitwise logical exclusive `OR` of the two operands. No overflows are possible from these operations.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined integer logical operators defined above are also predefined.

### Enumeration logical operators

Every enumeration type `E` implicitly provides the following predefined logical operators:

```csharp
E operator &(E x, E y);
E operator |(E x, E y);
E operator ^(E x, E y);
```

The result of evaluating `x op y`, where `x` and `y` are expressions of an enumeration type `E` with an underlying type `U`, and *op* is one of the logical operators, is exactly the same as evaluating `(E)((U)x *op *(U)y)`. In other words, the enumeration type logical operators simply perform the logical operation on the underlying type of the two operands.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined enumeration logical operators defined above are also predefined.

### Boolean logical operators

The predefined `Boolean` logical operators are:

```csharp
bool operator &(bool x, bool y);
bool operator |(bool x, bool y);
bool operator ^(bool x, bool y);
```

The result of `x & y` is `true` if both `x` and `y` are `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.

The result of `x | y` is `true` if either `x` or `y` is `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.

The result of `x ^ y` is `true` if `x` is `true` and `y` is `false`, or `x` is `false` and `y` is `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`. When the operands are of type `bool`, the `^` operator computes the same result as the `!=` operator.

### Nullable Boolean & and | operators

The nullable `Boolean` type `bool?` can represent three values, `true`, `false`, and `null`.

As with the other binary operators, lifted forms of the logical operators `&` and `|` (§12.12.4) are also pre-defined:

```csharp
bool? operator &(bool? x, bool? y);
bool? operator |(bool? x, bool? y);
```

The semantics of the lifted `&` and `|` operators are defined by the following table:

|  `x`       | `y`       | `x & y`   | `x | y`   |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|  true    | true    | true    | true    |
|  true    | false   | false   | true    |
|  true    | null    | null    | true    |
|  false   | true    | false   | true    |
|  false   | false   | false   | false   |
|  false   | null    | false   | null    |
|  null    | true    | null    | true    |
|  null    | false   | false   | null    |
|  null    | null    | null    | null    |

> [!NOTE]
> The `bool?` type is conceptually similar to the three-valued type used for `Boolean` expressions in SQL. The table above follows the same semantics as SQL, whereas applying the rules of §12.4.8 to the `&` and `|` operators would not. The rules of §12.4.8 already provide SQL-like semantics for the lifted `^` operator.

## Conditional logical operators

### General

The `&&` and `||` operators are called the conditional logical operators. They are also called the “short-circuiting” logical operators.

```antlr
conditional-and-expression:
    inclusive-or-expression
    conditional-and-expression && inclusive-or-expression

conditional-or-expression:
    conditional-and-expression
    conditional-or-expression || conditional-and-expression
```

The `&&` and `||` operators are conditional versions of the `&` and `|` operators:

- The operation `x && y` corresponds to the operation `x & y`, except that `y` is evaluated only if `x` is not `false`.
- The operation `x || y` corresponds to the operation `x | y`, except that `y` is evaluated only if `x` is not `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> The reason that short circuiting uses the 'not true' and 'not false' conditions is to enable user-defined conditional operators to define when short circuiting applies. User-defined types could be in a state where operator `true` returns `false` and operator `false` returns `false`. In those cases, neither `&&` nor `||` would short circuit.

If an operand of a conditional logical operator has the compile-time type dynamic, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case the compile-time type of the expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type `dynamic`.

An operation of the form `x && y` or `x || y` is processed by applying overload resolution (§12.4.5) as if the operation was written `x & y` or `x | y`. Then,

- If overload resolution fails to find a single best operator, or if overload resolution selects one of the predefined integer logical operators or nullable `Boolean` logical operators (§12.12.5), a binding-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, if the selected operator is one of the predefined `Boolean` logical operators (§12.12.4), the operation is processed as described in §12.13.2.
- Otherwise, the selected operator is a user-defined operator, and the operation is processed as described in §12.13.3.

It is not possible to directly overload the conditional logical operators. However, because the conditional logical operators are evaluated in terms of the regular logical operators, overloads of the regular logical operators are, with certain restrictions, also considered overloads of the conditional logical operators. This is described further in §12.13.3.

### Boolean conditional logical operators

When the operands of `&&` or `||` are of type bool, or when the operands are of types that do not define an applicable operator `&` or operator `|`, but do define implicit conversions to `bool`, the operation is processed as follows:

- The operation `x && y` is evaluated as `x ? y : false`. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and converted to type `bool`. Then, if `x` is `true`, `y` is evaluated and converted to type `bool`, and this becomes the result of the operation. Otherwise, the result of the operation is `false`.
- The operation `x || y` is evaluated as `x ? true : y`. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and converted to type `bool`. Then, if `x` is `true`, the result of the operation is `true`. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated and converted to type `bool`, and this becomes the result of the operation.

### User-defined conditional logical operators

When the operands of `&&` or `||` are of types that declare an applicable user-defined operator `&` or operator `|`, both of the following shall be true, where `T` is the type in which the selected operator is declared:

- The return type and the type of each parameter of the selected operator shall be `T`. In other words, the operator shall compute the logical `AND` or the logical `OR` of two operands of type `T`, and shall return a result of type `T`.
- `T` shall contain declarations of operator `true` and operator `false`.

A binding-time error occurs if either of these requirements is not satisfied. Otherwise, the `&&` or `||` operation is evaluated by combining the user-defined operator `true` or operator `false` with the selected user-defined operator:

- The operation `x && y` is evaluated as `T.false(x) ? x : T.&(x, y)`, where `T.false(x)` is an invocation of the operator `false` declared in `T`, and `T.&(x, y)` is an invocation of the selected operator `&`. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and operator `false` is invoked on the result to determine if `x` is definitely `false`. Then, if `x` is definitely `false`, the result of the operation is the value previously computed for `x`. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated, and the selected operator `&` is invoked on the value previously computed for `x` and the value computed for `y` to produce the result of the operation.
- The operation `x || y` is evaluated as `T.true(x) ? x : T.|(x, y)`, where `T.true(x)` is an invocation of the operator true declared in `T`, and `T.|(x, y)` is an invocation of the selected operator `|`. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and operator `true` is invoked on the result to determine if `x` is definitely `true`. Then, if `x` is definitely `true`, the result of the operation is the value previously computed for `x`. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated, and the selected operator `|` is invoked on the value previously computed for `x` and the value computed for `y` to produce the result of the operation.

In either of these operations, the expression given by `x` is only evaluated once, and the expression given by `y` is either not evaluated or evaluated exactly once.

## The null coalescing operator

The `??` operator is called the null coalescing operator.

```antlr
null-coalescing-expression:
    conditional-or-expression
    conditional-or-expression ?? null-coalescing-expression

A null coalescing expression of the form `a ?? b` requires `a` to be the `null` literal (§7.4.5.7), or to be of a nullable value type or reference type. If `a` is non-null, the result of `a ?? b` is `a;` otherwise, the result is `b`. The operation evaluates `b` only if `a` is `null`.

The null coalescing operator is right-associative, meaning that operations are grouped from right to left. [*Example*: An expression of the form `a ?? b ?? c` is evaluated as `a ?? (b ?? c)`. In general terms, an expression of the form `E1 ?? E2 ?? … ?? EN` returns the first of the operands that is non-null, or `null` if all operands are `null`. *end example*]

The type of the expression `a ?? b` depends on which implicit conversions are available on the operands. In order of preference, the type of `a ?? b` is `A0`, `A`, or `B`, where `A` is the type of `a` (provided that `a` has a type), `B` is the type of `b` (provided that `b` has a type), and `A0` is the underlying type of `A` if `A` is a nullable value type, or `A` otherwise. Specifically, `a ?? b` is processed as follows:

- If `A` exists and is not a nullable value type or a reference type, a compile-time error occurs.
- If `b` is a dynamic expression, the result type is `dynamic`. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If `a` is not null, `a` is converted to `dynamic`, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated, and this becomes the result.
- Otherwise, if `A` exists and is a nullable value type and an implicit conversion exists from `b` to `A0`, the result type is `A0`. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If `a` is not null, `a` is unwrapped to type `A0`, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and converted to type `A0`, and this becomes the result.
- Otherwise, if `A` exists and an implicit conversion exists from `b` to `A`, the result type is `A`. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If `a` is not `null`, `a` becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and converted to type `A`, and this becomes the result.
- Otherwise, if `A` exists and is a nullable value type, `b` has a type `B` and an implicit conversion exists from `A0` to `B`, the result type is `B`. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If `a` is not `null`, `a` is unwrapped to type `A0` and converted to type `B`, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and becomes the result.
- Otherwise, if `b` has a type `B` and an implicit conversion exists from `a` to `B`, the result type is `B`. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If `a` is not `null`, `a` is converted to type `B`, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and becomes the result.
- Otherwise, `a` and `b` are incompatible, and a compile-time error occurs.

## Conditional operator

The `?:` operator is called the conditional operator. It is at times also called the ternary operator.

```antlr
conditional-expression:
    null-coalescing-expression
    null-coalescing-expression ? expression : expression
```

A conditional expression of the form `b ? x : y` first evaluates the condition `b`. Then, if `b` is `true`, `x` is evaluated and becomes the result of the operation. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated and becomes the result of the operation. A conditional expression never evaluates both `x` and `y`.

The conditional operator is right-associative, meaning that operations are grouped from right to left. [*Example*: An expression of the form `a ? b : c ? d : e` is evaluated as `a ? b : (c ? d : e)`. *end example*]

The first operand of the `?:` operator shall be an expression that can be implicitly converted to `bool`, or an expression of a type that implements operator `true`. If neither of these requirements is satisfied, a compile-time error occurs.

The second and third operands, `x` and `y`, of the `?:` operator control the type of the conditional expression.

- If `x` has type `X` and `y` has type `Y` then,
  - If `X` and `Y` are the same type, then this is the type of the conditional expression.
  - Otherwise, if an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from `X` to `Y`, but not from `Y` to `X`, then `Y` is the type of the conditional expression.
  - Otherwise, if an implicit enumeration conversion (§11.2.4) exists from `X` to `Y`, then `Y` is the type of the conditional expression.
  - Otherwise, if an implicit enumeration conversion (§11.2.4) exists from `Y` to `X`, then `X` is the type of the conditional expression.
  - Otherwise, if an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from `Y` to `X`, but not from `X` to `Y`, then `X` is the type of the conditional expression.
  - Otherwise, no expression type can be determined, and a compile-time error occurs.
- If only one of `x` and `y` has a type, and both `x` and `y` are implicitly convertible to that type, then that is the type of the conditional expression.
- Otherwise, no expression type can be determined, and a compile-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a conditional expression of the form `b ? x : y` consists of the following steps:

- First, `b` is evaluated, and the `bool` value of `b` is determined:
  - If an implicit conversion from the type of `b` to `bool` exists, then this implicit conversion is performed to produce a `bool` value.
  - Otherwise, the operator true defined by the type of `b` is invoked to produce a `bool` value.
- If the `bool` value produced by the step above is `true`, then `x` is evaluated and converted to the type of the conditional expression, and this becomes the result of the conditional expression.
- Otherwise, `y` is evaluated and converted to the type of the conditional expression, and this becomes the result of the conditional expression.

## Anonymous function expressions

### General

An ***anonymous function*** is an expression that represents an “in-line” method definition. An anonymous function does not have a value or type in and of itself, but is convertible to a compatible delegate or expression-tree type. The evaluation of an anonymous-function conversion depends on the target type of the conversion: If it is a delegate type, the conversion evaluates to a delegate value referencing the method that the anonymous function defines. If it is an expression-tree type, the conversion evaluates to an expression tree that represents the structure of the method as an object structure.

> [!NOTE]
> For historical reasons, there are two syntactic flavors of anonymous functions, namely *lambda-expression*s and *anonymous-method-expression*s. For almost all purposes, *lambda-expression*s are more concise and expressive than *anonymous-method-expression*s, which remain in the language for backwards compatibility.

```antlr
lambda-expression:
    asyncopt anonymous-function-signature => anonymous-function-body

anonymous-method-expression:
    asyncopt delegate explicit-anonymous-function-signatureopt block

anonymous-function-signature:
    explicit-anonymous-function-signature
    implicit-anonymous-function-signature

explicit-anonymous-function-signature:
    ( explicit-anonymous-function-parameter-listopt )

explicit-anonymous-function-parameter-list:
    explicit-anonymous-function-parameter
    explicit-anonymous-function-parameter-list , explicit-anonymous-function-parameter

explicit-anonymous-function-parameter:
    anonymous-function-parameter-modifieropt type identifier

anonymous-function-parameter-modifier:
    ref
    out

implicit-anonymous-function-signature:
    ( implicit-anonymous-function-parameter-listopt )
    implicit-anonymous-function-parameter

implicit-anonymous-function-parameter-list:
    implicit-anonymous-function-parameter
    implicit-anonymous-function-parameter-list , implicit-anonymous-function-parameter

implicit-anonymous-function-parameter:
    identifier

anonymous-function-body:
    expression
    block
```

The `=>` operator has the same precedence as assignment (`=`) and is right-associative.

An anonymous function with the `async` modifier is an `async` function and follows the rules described in §15.15.

The parameters of an anonymous function in the form of a *lambda-expression* can be explicitly or implicitly typed. In an explicitly typed parameter list, the type of each parameter is explicitly stated. In an implicitly typed parameter list, the types of the parameters are inferred from the context in which the anonymous function occurs—specifically, when the anonymous function is converted to a compatible delegate type or expression tree type, that type provides the parameter types (§11.7).

In a *lambda-expression* with a single, implicitly typed parameter, the parentheses may be omitted from the parameter list. In other words, an anonymous function of the form

```
( *param* ) => *expr*
```

can be abbreviated to

```
*param* => *expr*
```

The parameter list of an anonymous function in the form of an *anonymous-method-expression* is optional. If given, the parameters shall be explicitly typed. If not, the anonymous function is convertible to a delegate with any parameter list not containing out parameters.

A *block* body of an anonymous function is always reachable (§13.2).

[*Example*: Some examples of anonymous functions follow below:

```csharp
x => x + 1 // Implicitly typed, expression body

x => { return x + 1; } // Implicitly typed, statement body

(int x) => x + 1 // Explicitly typed, expression body

(int x) => { return x + 1; } // Explicitly typed, statement body

(x, y) => x * y // Multiple parameters

() => Console.WriteLine () // No parameters

async (t1, t2) => await t1 + await t2 // Async

delegate (int x) { return x + 1; } // Anonymous method expression

delegate { return 1 + 1; } // Parameter list omitted
```

*end example*]

The behavior of *lambda-expression*s and *anonymous-method-expression*s is the same except for the following points:

- *anonymous-method-expression*s permit the parameter list to be omitted entirely, yielding convertibility to delegate types of any list of value parameters.
- *lambda-expression*s permit parameter types to be omitted and inferred whereas *anonymous-method-expression*s require parameter types to be explicitly stated.
- The body of a *lambda-expression* can be an expression or a statement block whereas the body of an *anonymous-method-expression* shall be a statement block.
- Only *lambda-expression*s have conversions to compatible expression tree types (§9.6).

### Anonymous function signatures

The *anonymous-function-signature* of an anonymous function defines the names and optionally the types of the formal parameters for the anonymous function. The scope of the parameters of the anonymous function is the *anonymous-function-body* (§8.7). Together with the parameter list (if given) the anonymous-method-body constitutes a declaration space (§8.3). It is thus a compile-time error for the name of a parameter of the anonymous function to match the name of a local variable, local constant or parameter whose scope includes the *anonymous-method-expression* or *lambda-expression*.

If an anonymous function has an *explicit-anonymous-function-signature*, then the set of compatible delegate types and expression tree types is restricted to those that have the same parameter types and modifiers in the same order (§11.7). In contrast to method group conversions (§11.8), contra-variance of anonymous function parameter types is not supported. If an anonymous function does not have an *anonymous-function-signature*, then the set of compatible delegate types and expression tree types is restricted to those that have no out parameters.

Note that an *anonymous-function-signature* cannot include attributes or a parameter array. Nevertheless, an *anonymous-function-signature* may be compatible with a delegate type whose parameter list contains a parameter array.

Note also that conversion to an expression tree type, even if compatible, may still fail at compile-time (§9.6).

### Anonymous function bodies

The body (*expression* or *block*) of an anonymous function is subject to the following rules:

- If the anonymous function includes a signature, the parameters specified in the signature are available in the body. If the anonymous function has no signature it can be converted to a delegate type or expression type having parameters (§11.7), but the parameters cannot be accessed in the body.
- Except for `ref` or `out` parameters specified in the signature (if any) of the nearest enclosing anonymous function, it is a compile-time error for the body to access a `ref` or `out` parameter.
- When the type of this is a struct type, it is a compile-time error for the body to access this. This is true whether the access is explicit (as in `this.x`) or implicit (as in `x` where `x` is an instance member of the struct). This rule simply prohibits such access and does not affect whether member lookup results in a member of the struct.
- The body has access to the outer variables (§12.16.6) of the anonymous function. Access of an outer variable will reference the instance of the variable that is active at the time the *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression* is evaluated (§12.16.7).
- It is a compile-time error for the body to contain a goto statement, a break statement, or a continue statement whose target is outside the body or within the body of a contained anonymous function.
- A return statement in the body returns control from an invocation of the nearest enclosing anonymous function, not from the enclosing function member.

It is explicitly unspecified whether there is any way to execute the block of an anonymous function other than through evaluation and invocation of the *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression*. In particular, the compiler may choose to implement an anonymous function by synthesizing one or more named methods or types. The names of any such synthesized elements shall be of a form reserved for compiler use (§7.4.3).

### Overload resolution

Anonymous functions in an argument list participate in type inference and overload resolution. Refer to §12.6.3 and §12.6.4 for the exact rules.

[*Example*: The following example illustrates the effect of anonymous functions on overload resolution.

```csharp
class ItemList<T> : List<T>
{
    public int Sum (Func<T, int> selector)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        foreach (T item in this) sum += selector (item);
        return sum;
    }

    public double Sum (Func<T, double> selector)
    {
        double sum = 0;
        foreach (T item in this) sum += selector (item);
        return sum;
    }
}
```

The `ItemList<T>` class has two `Sum` methods. Each takes a selector argument, which extracts the value to sum over from a list item. The extracted value can be either an `int` or a `double` and the resulting sum is likewise either an `int` or a `double`.

The `Sum` methods could for example be used to compute sums from a list of detail lines in an order.

```csharp
class Detail
{
    public int UnitCount;
    public double UnitPrice;
    …
}

void ComputeSums ()
{
    ItemList<Detail> orderDetails = GetOrderDetails (…);
    int totalUnits = orderDetails.Sum (d => d.UnitCount);
    double orderTotal = orderDetails.Sum (d => d.UnitPrice * d.UnitCount);
    …
}
```

In the first invocation of `orderDetails.Sum`, both Sum methods are applicable because the anonymous function `d => d.UnitCount` is compatible with both `Func<Detail,int>` and `Func<Detail,double>`. However, overload resolution picks the first `Sum` method because the conversion to `Func<Detail,int>` is better than the conversion to `Func<Detail,double>`.

In the second invocation of `orderDetails.Sum`, only the second `Sum` method is applicable because the anonymous function `d => d.UnitPrice * d.UnitCount` produces a value of type `double`. Thus, overload resolution picks the second `Sum` method for that invocation. *end example*]

### Anonymous functions and dynamic binding

An anonymous function cannot be a receiver, argument, or operand of a dynamically bound operation.

### Outer variables

#### General

Any local variable, value parameter, or parameter array whose scope includes the *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression* is called an ***outer variable*** of the anonymous function. In an instance function member of a class, the this value is considered a value parameter and is an outer variable of any anonymous function contained within the function member.

#### Captured outer variables

When an outer variable is referenced by an anonymous function, the outer variable is said to have been ***captured*** by the anonymous function. Ordinarily, the lifetime of a local variable is limited to execution of the block or statement with which it is associated (§10.2.8). However, the lifetime of a captured outer variable is extended at least until the delegate or expression tree created from the anonymous function becomes eligible for garbage collection.

[*Example*: In the example

```csharp
using System;

delegate int D ();

class Test
{
    static D F ()
    {
        int x = 0;
        D result = () => ++x;
        return result;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        D d = F ();
        Console.WriteLine (d ());
        Console.WriteLine (d ());
        Console.WriteLine (d ());
    }
}
```

the local variable `x` is captured by the anonymous function, and the lifetime of `x` is extended at least until the delegate returned from `F` becomes eligible for garbage collection. Since each invocation of the anonymous function operates on the same instance of `x`, the output of the example is:

```plaintext
1
2
3
```

*end example*]

When a local variable or a value parameter is captured by an anonymous function, the local variable or parameter is no longer considered to be a fixed variable (§23.4), but is instead considered to be a moveable variable. However, captured outer variables cannot be used in a fixed statement (§23.7), so the address of a captured outer variable cannot be taken.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike an uncaptured variable, a captured local variable can be simultaneously exposed to multiple threads of execution.

#### Instantiation of local variables

A local variable is considered to be ***instantiated*** when execution enters the scope of the variable. [*Example*: For example, when the following method is invoked, the local variable `x` is instantiated and initialized three times—once for each iteration of the loop.

```csharp
static void F ()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        int x = i * 2 + 1;
        …
    }
}
```

However, moving the declaration of `x` outside the loop results in a single instantiation of `x`:

```csharp
static void F ()
{
    int x;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        x = i * 2 + 1;
        …
    }
}
```

*end exampleI]

When not captured, there is no way to observe exactly how often a local variable is instantiated—because the lifetimes of the instantiations are disjoint, it is possible for each instantation to simply use the same storage location. However, when an anonymous function captures a local variable, the effects of instantiation become apparent.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

delegate void D ();

class Test
{
    static D[] F ()
    {
        D[] result = new D[3];
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            int x = i * 2 + 1;
            result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine (x); };
        }
        return result;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        foreach (D d in F ()) d ();
    }
}
```

produces the output:

```plaintext
1
3
5
```

However, when the declaration of x is moved outside the loop:

```csharp
static D[] F ()
{
    D[] result = new D[3];
    int x;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        x = i * 2 + 1;
        result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine (x); };
    }
    return result;
}
```

the output is:

```plaintext
5
5
5
```

Note that the compiler is permitted (but not required) to optimize the three instantiations into a single delegate instance (§11.7.2).

*end example*]

If a for-loop declares an iteration variable, that variable itself is considered to be declared outside of the loop. [*Example*: Thus, if the example is changed to capture the iteration variable itself:

```csharp
static D[] F ()
{
    D[] result = new D[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine (i); };
    }
    return result;
}
```

only one instance of the iteration variable is captured, which produces the output:

```plaintext
3
3
3
```

*end example*]

It is possible for anonymous function delegates to share some captured variables yet have separate instances of others. [*Example*: For example, if `F` is changed to

```csharp
static D[] F ()
{
    D[] result = new D[3];
    int x = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        int y = 0;
        result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine ("{0} {1}", ++x, ++y); };
    }
    return result;
}
```

the three delegates capture the same instance of `x` but separate instances of `y`, and the output is:

```plaintext
1 1
2 1
3 1
```

*end example*]

Separate anonymous functions can capture the same instance of an outer variable. [*Example*: In the example:

```csharp
using System;

delegate void Setter (int value);

delegate int Getter ();

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int x = 0;
        Setter s = (int value) => { x = value; };
        Getter g = () => { return x; };
        s (5);
        Console.WriteLine (g ());
        s (10);
        Console.WriteLine (g ());
    }
}
```
the two anonymous functions capture the same instance of the local variable `x`, and they can thus “communicate” through that variable. The output of the example is:

```plaintext
5
10
```

*end example*]

### Evaluation of anonymous function expressions

An anonymous function `F` shall always be converted to a delegate type `D` or an expression-tree type `E`, either directly or through the execution of a delegate creation expression `new D(F)`. This conversion determines the result of the anonymous function, as described in §11.7.

### Implementation Exmple

**This subclause is informative.**

This subclause describes a possible implementation of anonymous function conversions in terms of other C# constructs. The implementation described here is based on the same principles used by a commercial C# compiler, but it is by no means a mandated implementation, nor is it the only one possible. It only briefly mentions conversions to expression trees, as their exact semantics are outside the scope of this specification.

The remainder of this subclause gives several examples of code that contains anonymous functions with different characteristics. For each example, a corresponding translation to code that uses only other C# constructs is provided. In the examples, the identifier `D` is assumed by represent the following delegate type:

```csharp
public delegate void D();
```

The simplest form of an anonymous function is one that captures no outer variables:

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void F ()
    {
        D d = () => { Console.WriteLine ("test"); };
    }
}
```

This can be translated to a delegate instantiation that references a compiler generated static method in which the code of the anonymous function is placed:

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void F ()
    {
        D d = new D (__Method1);
    }

    static void __Method1 ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("test");
    }
}
```

In the following example, the anonymous function references instance members of this:

```csharp
class Test
{
    int x;

    void F ()
    {
        D d = () => { Console.WriteLine (x); };
    }
}
```

This can be translated to a compiler generated instance method containing the code of the anonymous function:

```csharp
class Test
{
    int x;

    void F ()
    {
        D d = new D (__Method1);
    }

    void __Method1 ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine (x);
    }
}
```

In this example, the anonymous function captures a local variable:

```csharp
class Test
{
    void F ()
    {
        int y = 123;
        D d = () => { Console.WriteLine (y); };
    }
}
```

The lifetime of the local variable must now be extended to at least the lifetime of the anonymous function delegate. This can be achieved by “hoisting” the local variable into a field of a compiler-generated class. Instantiation of the local variable (§12.16.6.3) then corresponds to creating an instance of the compiler generated class, and accessing the local variable corresponds to accessing a field in the instance of the compiler generated class. Furthermore, the anonymous function becomes an instance method of the compiler-generated class:

```csharp
class Test
{
    void F ()
    {
        __Locals1 __locals1 = new __Locals1 ();
        __locals1.y = 123;
        D d = new D (__locals1.__Method1);
    }

    class __Locals1
    {
        public int y;

        public void __Method1 ()
        {
            Console.WriteLine (y);
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, the following anonymous function captures this as well as two local variables with different lifetimes:

```csharp
class Test
{
    int x;

    void F ()
    {
        int y = 123;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            int z = i * 2;
            D d = () => { Console.WriteLine (x + y + z); };
        }
    }
}
```

Here, a compiler-generated class is created for each statement block in which locals are captured such that the locals in the different blocks can have independent lifetimes. An instance of `__Locals2`, the compiler generated class for the inner statement block, contains the local variable `z` and a field that references an instance of `__Locals1`. An instance of `__Locals1`, the compiler generated class for the outer statement block, contains the local variable `y` and a field that references this of the enclosing function member. With these data structures, it is possible to reach all captured outer variables through an instance of `__Local2`, and the code of the anonymous function can thus be implemented as an instance method of that class.

```csharp
class Test
{
    void F ()
    {
        __Locals1 __locals1 = new __Locals1 ();
        __locals1.__this = this;
        __locals1.y = 123;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            __Locals2 __locals2 = new __Locals2 ();
            __locals2.__locals1 = __locals1;
            __locals2.z = i * 2;
            D d = new D (__locals2.__Method1);
        }
    }

    class __Locals1
    {
        public Test __this;
        public int y;
    }

    class __Locals2
    {
        public __Locals1 __locals1;
        public int z;

        public void __Method1 ()
        {
            Console.WriteLine (__locals1.__this.x + __locals1.y + z);
        }
    }
}
```

The same technique applied here to capture local variables can also be used when converting anonymous functions to expression trees: references to the compiler-generated objects can be stored in the expression tree, and access to the local variables can be represented as field accesses on these objects. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the “lifted” local variables to be shared between delegates and expression trees.

## Query expressions

### General

***Query expressions*** provide a language-integrated syntax for queries that is similar to relational and hierarchical query languages such as SQL and XQuery.

```antlr
query-expression:
    from-clause query-body

from-clause:
    from typeopt identifier in expression

query-body:
    query-body-clausesopt select-or-group-clause query-continuationopt

query-body-clauses:
    query-body-clause
    query-body-clauses query-body-clause

query-body-clause:
    from-clause
    let-clause
    where-clause
    join-clause
    join-into-clause
    orderby-clause

let-clause:
    let identifier = expression

where-clause:
    where boolean-expression

join-clause:
    join typeopt identifier in expression on expression equals expression

join-into-clause:
    join typeopt identifier in expression on expression equals expression into identifier

orderby-clause:
    orderby orderings

orderings:
    ordering
    orderings , ordering

ordering:
    expression ordering-directionopt

ordering-direction:
    ascending
    descending

select-or-group-clause:
    select-clause
    group-clause

select-clause:
    select expression

group-clause:
    group expression by expression

query-continuation:
    into identifier query-body
```

A query expression begins with a from clause and ends with either a select or group clause. The initial from clause may be followed by zero or more from, let, where, join or orderby clauses. Each from clause is a generator introducing a ***range variable*** that ranges over the elements of a ***sequence***. Each let clause introduces a range variable representing a value computed by means of previous range variables. Each where clause is a filter that excludes items from the result. Each join clause compares specified keys of the source sequence with keys of another sequence, yielding matching pairs. Each orderby clause reorders items according to specified criteria.The final select or group clause specifies the shape of the result in terms of the range variables. Finally, an into clause can be used to “splice” queries by treating the results of one query as a generator in a subsequent query.

### Ambiguities in query expressions

Query expressions use a number of contextual keywords (§7.4.4): ascending, by, descending, equals, from, group, into, join, let, on, orderly, select and where.

To avoid ambiguities that could arise from the use of these identifiers both as keywords and simple names these identifiers are considered keywords anywhere within a query expression, unless they are prefixed with “@” (§7.4.4) in which case they are considered identifiers. For this purpose, a query expression is any expression that starts with “from *identifier*” followed by any token except* *“;”, “=” or* *“,”.

### Query expression translation

#### General

The C# language does not specify the execution semantics of query expressions. Rather, query expressions are translated into invocations of methods that adhere to the query*-*expression pattern (§12.17.4). Specifically, query expressions are translated into invocations of methods named `Where`, `Select`, `SelectMany`, `Join`, `GroupJoin`, `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, `ThenBy`, `ThenByDescending`, `GroupBy`, and `Cast`. These methods are expected to have particular signatures and return types, as described in §12.17.4. These methods may be instance methods of the object being queried or extension methods that are external to the object. These methods implement the actual execution of the query.

The translation from query expressions to method invocations is a syntactic mapping that occurs before any type binding or overload resolution has been performed. Following translation of query expressions, the resulting method invocations are processed as regular method invocations, and this may in turn uncover compile time errors. These error conditions include, but are not limited to, methods that do not exist, arguments of the wrong types, and generic methods where type inference fails.

A query expression is processed by repeatedly applying the following translations until no further reductions are possible. The translations are listed in order of application: each section assumes that the translations in the preceding sections have been performed exhaustively, and once exhausted, a section will not later be revisited in the processing of the same query expression.

It is a compile time error for a query expression to include an assignment to a range variable, or the use of a range variable as an argument for a ref or out parameter.

Certain translations inject range variables with *transparent identifiers* denoted by `*`. These are described further in §12.17.3.8.

#### select and group … by clauses with continuations

A query expression with a group clause using a property `Prop` of `y` and a query body `Q` containing a continuation in the form:

```csharp
from y in S group y by y.Prop into x Q
```

is translated into:

```csharp
from x in ( from y in S group y by y.Prop ) Q
```

The translations in the following sections assume that queries have no into continuations.

[*Example*: The example:

```csharp
from c in customers
group c by c.Country into g
select new { Country = g.Key, CustCount = g.Count () }
```

is translated into:

```csharp
from g in
    (from c in customers group c by c.Country)
select new { Country = g.Key, CustCount = g.Count () }
```

the final translation of which is:

```csharp
customers.
GroupBy (c => c.Country).
Select (g => new { Country = g.Key, CustCount = g.Count () })
```

*end example*]

#### Explicit range variable types

A from clause that explicitly specifies a range variable type

```csharp
from T x in e
```

is translated into

```csharp
from x in (e).Cast<T> ()
```

A join clause that explicitly specifies a range variable type

```csharp
join T x in e on k1 equals k2
```

is translated into

```csharp
join x in (e).Cast<T> () on k1 equals k2
```

The translations in the following sections assume that queries have no explicit range variable types.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from Customer c in customers
where c.City == "London"
select c
```

is translated into

```csharp
from c in (customers).Cast<Customer> ()
where c.City == "London"
select c
```

the final translation of which is

```csharp
customers.
Cast<Customer> ().
Where (c => c.City == "London")
```

*end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> Explicit range variable types are useful for querying collections that implement the non-generic `IEnumerable` interface, but not the generic `IEnumerable<T>` interface. In the example above, this would be the case if `customers` were of type `ArrayList`.

#### Degenerate query expressions

A query expression of the form

```csharp
from x in e select x
```

is translated into

```csharp
(e).Select (x => x)
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
select c
```

Is translated into

```csharp
(customers).Select(c => c)
```

*end example*]

A degenerate query expression is one that trivially selects the elements of the source.

> [!NOTE]
> Later phases of the translation (§12.17.3.6 and §12.17.3.7) remove degenerate queries introduced by other translation steps by replacing them with their source. It is important, however, to ensure that the result of a query expression is never the source object itself. Otherwise, returning the result of such a query might inadvertently expose private data (e.g., an element array) to a caller. Therefore this step protects degenerate queries written directly in source code by explicitly calling `Select` on the source. It is then up to the implementers of `Select` and other query operators to ensure that these methods never return the source object itself.

#### From, let, where, join and orderby clauses

A query expression with a second from clause followed by a select clause

```csharp
from x1 in e1
from x2 in e2
select v
```

is translated into

```csharp
(e1).SelectMany (x1 => e2, (x1, x2) => v)
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
from o in c.Orders
select new { c.Name, o.OrderID, o.Total }
```

is translated into

```csharp
(customers).
SelectMany (c => c.Orders,
    (c, o) => new { c.Name, o.OrderID, o.Total }
)
```

*end example*]

A query expression with a second from clause followed by a query body `Q` containing a non-empty set of query body clauses:

```csharp
from x1 in e1
from x2 in e2
Q
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (e1).SelectMany (x1 => e2, (x1, x2) => new { x1, x2 })
Q
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
from o in c.Orders
orderby o.Total descending
select new { c.Name, o.OrderID, o.Total }
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (customers).
SelectMany (c => c.Orders, (c, o) => new { c, o })
orderby o.Total descending
select new { c.Name, o.OrderID, o.Total }
```

the final translation of which is

```csharp
customers.
SelectMany (c => c.Orders, (c, o) => new { c, o }).
OrderByDescending (x => x.o.Total).
Select (x => new { x.c.Name, x.o.OrderID, x.o.Total })
```

where `x` is a compiler generated identifier that is otherwise invisible and inaccessible. *end example*]

A let expression along with its preceding from clause:

```csharp
from x in e
let y = f
…
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (e).Select (x => new { x, y = f })
…
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from o in orders
let t = o.Details.Sum (d => d.UnitPrice * d.Quantity)
where t >= 1000
select new { o.OrderID, Total = t }
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (orders).
Select (o => new { o, t = o.Details.Sum (d => d.UnitPrice * d.Quantity) })
where t >= 1000
select new { o.OrderID, Total = t }
```

the final translation of which is

```csharp
orders.
Select (o => new { o, t = o.Details.Sum (d => d.UnitPrice * d.Quantity) }).
Where (x => x.t >= 1000).
Select (x => new { x.o.OrderID, Total = x.t })
```

where `x` is a compiler generated identifier that is otherwise invisible and inaccessible. *end example*]

A where expression along with its preceding from clause:

```csharp
from x in e
where f
…
```

is translated into

```csharp
from x in (e).Where (x => f)
…
```

A join clause immediately followed by a select clause

```csharp
from x1 in e1
join x2 in e2 on k1 equals k2
select v
```

is translated into

```csharp
(e1).Join (e2, x1 => k1, x2 => k2, (x1, x2) => v)
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
join o in orders on c.CustomerID equals o.CustomerID
select new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, o.Total }
```

is translated into

```csharp
(customers).Join (orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID,
    (c, o) => new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, o.Total })
```

*end example*]

A join clause followed by a query body clause:

```csharp
from x1 in e1
join x2 in e2 on k1 equals k2
…
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (e1).Join (
    e2, x1 => k1, x2 => k2, (x1, x2) => new { x1, x2 })
…
```

A join-into clause immediately followed by a select clause

```csharp
from x1 in e1
join x2 in e2 on k1 equals k2 into g
select v
```

is translated into

```csharp
(e1).GroupJoin (e2, x1 => k1, x2 => k2, (x1, g) => v)```

A join into clause followed by a query body clause

```csharp
from x1 in e1
join x2 in e2 on k1 equals k2 into g
…
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (e1).GroupJoin (
    e2, x1 => k1, x2 => k2, (x1, g) => new { x1, g })
…
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
join o in orders on c.CustomerID equals o.CustomerID into co
let n = co.Count ()
where n >= 10
select new { c.Name, OrderCount = n }
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (customers).
GroupJoin (orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID,
    (c, co) => new { c, co })
let n = co.Count ()
where n >= 10
select new { c.Name, OrderCount = n }
```

the final translation of which is

```csharp
customers.
GroupJoin (orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID,
    (c, co) => new { c, co }).
Select (x => new { x, n = x.co.Count () }).
Where (y => y.n >= 10).
Select (y => new { y.x.c.Name, OrderCount = y.n)
```

where `x` and `y` are compiler generated identifiers that are otherwise invisible and inaccessible. *end example*]

An orderby clause and its preceding from clause:

```csharp
from x in e
orderby k1, k2, …, kn
…
```

is translated into

```csharp
from x in (e).
OrderBy (x => k1).
ThenBy (x => k2).
….
ThenBy (x => kn)
…
```

If an ordering clause specifies a descending direction indicator, an invocation of `OrderByDescending` or `ThenByDescending` is produced instead.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from o in orders
orderby o.Customer.Name, o.Total descending
select o
```

has the final translation

```csharp
(orders).
OrderBy (o => o.Customer.Name).
ThenByDescending (o => o.Total)
```

*end example*]

The following translations assume that there are no let, where, join or orderby clauses, and no more than the one initial from clause in each query expression.

#### Select clauses

A query expression of the form

```csharp
from x in e select v
```

is translated into

```csharp
(e).Select (x => v)
```

except when *`v`* is the identifier *`x`*, the translation is simply

```csharp
(e)
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers.Where (c => c.City == “London”)
select c
```

is simply translated into

```csharp
(customers).Where(c => c.City == “London”)
```

*end example*]

#### Group clauses

A group clause

```csharp
from x in e group v by k
```

is translated into

```csharp
(e).GroupBy (x => k, x => v)
```

except when *`v`* is the identifier *`x`*, the translation is

```csharp
(e).GroupBy (x => k)
```

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
group c.Name by c.Country
```

is translated into

```csharp
(customers).
GroupBy (c => c.Country, c => c.Name)
```

*end example*]

#### Transparent identifiers

Certain translations inject range variables with ***transparent identifiers*** denoted by *. Transparent identifiers exist only as an intermediate step in the query-expression translation process.

When a query translation injects a transparent identifier, further translation steps propagate the transparent identifier into anonymous functions and anonymous object initializers. In those contexts, transparent identifiers have the following behavior:

- When a transparent identifier occurs as a parameter in an anonymous function, the members of the associated anonymous type are automatically in scope in the body of the anonymous function.
- When a member with a transparent identifier is in scope, the members of that member are in scope as well.
- When a transparent identifier occurs as a member declarator in an anonymous object initializer, it introduces a member with a transparent identifier.

In the translation steps described above, transparent identifiers are always introduced together with anonymous types, with the intent of capturing multiple range variables as members of a single object. An implementation of C# is permitted to use a different mechanism than anonymous types to group together multiple range variables. The following translation examples assume that anonymous types are used, and shows one possible translation of transparent identifiers.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
from o in c.Orders
orderby o.Total descending
select new { c.Name, o.Total }
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (customers).
SelectMany (c => c.Orders, (c, o) => new { c, o })
orderby o.Total descending
select new { c.Name, o.Total }
```

which is further translated into

```csharp
customers.
SelectMany (c => c.Orders, (c, o) => new { c, o }).
OrderByDescending ( * => o.Total).
Select ( * => new { c.Name, o.Total })
```

which, when transparent identifiers are erased, is equivalent to

```csharp
customers.
SelectMany (c => c.Orders, (c, o) => new { c, o }).
OrderByDescending (x => x.o.Total).
Select (x => new { x.c.Name, x.o.Total })
```

where `x` is a compiler generated identifier that is otherwise invisible and inaccessible.

The example

```csharp
from c in customers
join o in orders on c.CustomerID equals o.CustomerID
join d in details on o.OrderID equals d.OrderID
join p in products on d.ProductID equals p.ProductID
select new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, p.ProductName }
```

is translated into

```csharp
from * in (customers).
Join (orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID,
    (c, o) => new { c, o })
join d in details on o.OrderID equals d.OrderID
join p in products on d.ProductID equals p.ProductID
select new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, p.ProductName }
```

which is further reduced to

```csharp
customers.
Join (orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID, (c, o) => new { c, o }).
Join (details, * => o.OrderID, d => d.OrderID, ( * , d) => new {*, d }).
Join (products, * => d.ProductID, p => p.ProductID, ( * , p) => new {*, p }).
Select ( * => new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, p.ProductName })
```

the final translation of which is

```csharp
customers.
Join (orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID,
    (c, o) => new { c, o }).
Join (details, x => x.o.OrderID, d => d.OrderID,
    (x, d) => new { x, d }).
Join (products, y => y.d.ProductID, p => p.ProductID,
    (y, p) => new { y, p }).
Select (z => new { z.y.x.c.Name, z.y.x.o.OrderDate, z.p.ProductName })
```

where `x`, `y`, and `z` are compiler-generated identifiers that are otherwise invisible and inaccessible.

*end example*]

### The query-expression pattern

The ***Query-expression pattern*** establishes a pattern of methods that types can implement to support query expressions.

A generic type `C<T>` supports the query-expression-pattern if its public member methods and the publicly accessible extension methods could be replaced by the following class definition. The members and accessible extenson methods is referred to as the "shape" of a generic type `C<T>`. A generic type is used in order to illustrate the proper relationships between parameter and return types, but it is possible to implement the pattern for non-generic types as well.

```csharp
delegate R Func<T1, R> (T1 arg1);

delegate R Func<T1, T2, R> (T1 arg1, T2 arg2);

class C
{
    public C<T> Cast<T> ();
}

class C<T> : C
{
    public C<T> Where (Func<T, bool> predicate);

    public C<U> Select<U> (Func<T, U> selector);

    public C<V> SelectMany<U, V> (Func<T, C<U>> selector,
        Func<T, U, V> resultSelector);

    public C<V> Join<U, K, V> (C<U> inner, Func<T, K> outerKeySelector,
        Func<U, K> innerKeySelector, Func<T, U, V> resultSelector);

    public C<V> GroupJoin<U, K, V> (C<U> inner, Func<T, K> outerKeySelector,
        Func<U, K> innerKeySelector, Func<T, C<U>, V> resultSelector);

    public O<T> OrderBy<K> (Func<T, K> keySelector);

    public O<T> OrderByDescending<K> (Func<T, K> keySelector);

    public C<G<K, T>> GroupBy<K> (Func<T, K> keySelector);

    public C<G<K, E>> GroupBy<K, E> (Func<T, K> keySelector,
        Func<T, E> elementSelector);
}

class O<T> : C<T>
{
    public O<T> ThenBy<K> (Func<T, K> keySelector);

    public O<T> ThenByDescending<K> (Func<T, K> keySelector);
}

class G<K, T> : C<T>
{
    public K Key { get; }
}
```

The methods above use the generic delegate types` Func<T1, R>` and `Func<T1, T2, R>`, but they could equally well have used other delegate or expression-tree types with the same relationships in parameter and return types.

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended relationship between `C<T>` and `O<T>` that ensures that the `ThenBy` and `ThenByDescending` methods are available only on the result of an `OrderBy` or `OrderByDescending`.

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended shape of the result of `GroupBy`—a sequence of sequences, where each inner sequence has an additional `Key` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because query expressions are translated to method invocations by means of a syntactic mapping, types have considerable flexibility in how they implement any or all of the query-expression pattern. For example, the methods of the pattern can be implemented as instance methods or as extension methods because the two have the same invocation syntax, and the methods can request delegates or expression trees because anonymous functions are convertible to both. Types implementing only some of the query expression pattern support only query expression translations that map to the methods that type supports.

> [!NOTE]
> The `System.Linq` namespace provides an implementation of the query-expression pattern for any type that implements the `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>` interface.

## Assignment operators

### General

The assignment operators assign a new value to a variable, a property, an event, or an indexer element.

```antlr
assignment:
    unary-expression assignment-operator expression

assignment-operator:
    *=
    +=
    -=
    *=
    /=
    %=
    &=
    |=
    ^=
    <<=
    right-shift-assignment
```

The left operand of an assignment shall be an expression classified as a variable, a property access, an indexer access, or an event access.

The `=` operator is called the ***simple assignment operator***. It assigns the value of the right operand to the variable, property, or indexer element given by the left operand. The left operand of the simple assignment operator shall not be an event access (except as described in §15.8.2). The simple assignment operator is described in §12.18.2.

The assignment operators other than the `=` operator are called the ***compound assignment operators***. These operators perform the indicated operation on the two operands, and then assign the resulting value to the variable, property, or indexer element given by the left operand. The compound assignment operators are described in §12.18.3.

The `+=` and `-=` operators with an event access expression as the left operand are called the ***event assignment operators***. No other assignment operator is valid with an event access as the left operand. The event assignment operators are described in §12.18.4.

The assignment operators are right-associative, meaning that operations are grouped from right to left. [*Example*: An expression of the form `a = b = c` is evaluated as `a = (b = c)`. *end example*]

### Simple assignment

The `=` operator is called the simple assignment operator.

If the left operand of a simple assignment is of the form `E.P` or `E[Ei]` where E has the compile-time type dynamic, then the assignment is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the assignment expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time based on the run-time type of `E`. If the left operand is of the form `E[Ei]` where at least one element of `Ei` has the compile-time type dynamic, and the compile-time type of `E` is not an array, the resulting indexer access is dynamically bound, but with limited compile-time checking (§12.6.5).

In a simple assignment, the right operand shall be an expression that is implicitly convertible to the type of the left operand. The operation assigns the value of the right operand to the variable, property, or indexer element given by the left operand.

The result of a simple assignment expression is the value assigned to the left operand. The result has the same type as the left operand, and is always classified as a value.

If the left operand is a property or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have an accessible set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a simple assignment of the form `x = y` consists of the following steps:

- If `x` is classified as a variable:
  - `x` is evaluated to produce the variable.
  - `y` is evaluated and, if required, converted to the type of `x` through an implicit conversion (§11.2).
  - If the variable given by `x` is an array element of a *reference-type*, a run-time check is performed to ensure that the value computed for `y` is compatible with the array instance of which `x` is an element. The check succeeds if `y` is `null`, or if an implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7) exists from the -type of the instance referenced by `y` to the actual element type of the array instance containing `x`. Otherwise, a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` is thrown.
  - The value resulting from the evaluation and conversion of `y` is stored into the location given by the evaluation of `x`.
- If `x` is classified as a property or indexer access:
  - The instance expression (if `x` is not static) and the argument list (if `x` is an indexer access) associated with `x` are evaluated, and the results are used in the subsequent set accessor invocation.
  - `y` is evaluated and, if required, converted to the type of `x` through an implicit conversion (§11.2).
  - The set accessor of `x` is invoked with the value computed for `y` as its value argument.

> [!NOTE]
> If the compile time type of `x` is `dynamic` and there is an implicit conversion from the compile time type of `y` to `dynamic`, no runtime resolution is required.

> [!NOTE]
> The array co-variance rules (§17.6) permit a value of an array type `A[]` to be a reference to an instance of an array type `B[]`, provided an implicit reference conversion exists from `B` to `A`. Because of these rules, assignment to an array element of a *reference-type* requires a run-time check to ensure that the value being assigned is compatible with the array instance. In the example
> 
> ```csharp
> string[] sa = new string[10];
> object[] oa = sa;
> 
> oa[0] = null; // Ok
> oa[1] = "Hello"; // Ok
> oa[2] = new ArrayList (); // ArrayTypeMismatchException
> ```
> 
> the last assignment causes a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` to be thrown because a reference to an `ArrayList` cannot be stored in an element of a `string[]`.

When a property or indexer declared in a *struct-type* is the target of an assignment, the instance expression associated with the property or indexer access shall be classified as a variable. If the instance expression is classified as a value, a binding-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> Because of §12.7.5, the same rule also applies to fields.

[*Example*: Given the declarations:

```csharp
struct Point
{
    int x, y;

    public Point (int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int X
    {
        get { return x; }
        set { x = value; }
    }

    public int Y
    {
        get { return y; }
        set { y = value; }
    }
}

struct Rectangle
{
    Point a, b;

    public Rectangle (Point a, Point b)
    {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
    }

    public Point A
    {
        get { return a; }
        set { a = value; }
    }

    public Point B
    {
        get { return b; }
        set { b = value; }
    }
}
```

in the example

```csharp
Point p = new Point ();
p.X = 100;
p.Y = 100;
Rectangle r = new Rectangle ();
r.A = new Point (10, 10);
r.B = p;
```

the assignments to `p.X`, `p.Y`, `r.A`, and `r.B` are permitted because `p` and `r` are variables. However, in the example

```csharp
Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
r.A.X = 10;
r.A.Y = 10;
r.B.X = 100;
r.B.Y = 100;
```

the assignments are all invalid, since `r.A` and `r.B` are not variables. *end example*]

### Compound assignment

If the left operand of a compound assignment is of the form `E.P` or `E[Ei]` where `E` has the compile-time type `dynamic`, then the assignment is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the assignment expression is `dynamic`, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time based on the run-time type of `E`. If the left operand is of the form `E[Ei]` where at least one element of `Ei` has the compile-time type `dynamic`, and the compile-time type of `E` is not an array, the resulting indexer access is dynamically bound, but with limited compile-time checking (§12.6.5).

An operation of the form `x *op*= y` is processed by applying binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) as if the operation was written `x *op *y`. Then,

- If the return type of the selected operator is implicitly convertible to the type of `x`, the operation is evaluated as `x = x op y`, except that `x` is evaluated only once.
- Otherwise, if the selected operator is a predefined operator, if the return type of the selected operator is explicitly convertible to the type of `x` , and if `y` is implicitly convertible to the type of `x`  or the operator is a shift operator, then the operation is evaluated as `x = (T)(x *op *y)`, where `T` is the type of `x`, except that `x` is evaluated only once.
- Otherwise, the compound assignment is invalid, and a binding-time error occurs.

The term “evaluated only once” means that in the evaluation of `x *op* y`, the results of any constituent expressions of `x` are temporarily saved and then reused when performing the assignment to `x`. [*Example*: In the assignment `A()[B()] += C()`, where `A` is a method returning `int[]`, and `B` and `C` are methods returning int, the methods are invoked only once, in the order `A`, `B`, `C`. *end example*]

When the left operand of a compound assignment is a property access or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have both a get accessor and a set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

The second rule above permits `x *op*= y` to be evaluated as `x = (T)(x *op *y)` in certain contexts. The rule exists such that the predefined operators can be used as compound operators when the left operand is of type `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, or `char`. Even when both arguments are of one of those types, the predefined operators produce a result of type `int`, as described in §12.4.7.3. Thus, without a cast it would not be possible to assign the result to the left operand.

The intuitive effect of the rule for predefined operators is simply that `x *op*= y` is permitted if both of `x *op* y` and `x = y` are permitted. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
byte b = 0;
char ch = '\0';
int i = 0;

b += 1; // Ok
b += 1000; // Error, b = 1000 not permitted
b += i; // Error, b = i not permitted
b += (byte) i; // Ok

ch += 1; // Error, ch = 1 not permitted
ch += (char) 1; // Ok
```

the intuitive reason for each error is that a corresponding simple assignment would also have been an error. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> This also means that compound assignment operations support lifted operators. Since a compound assignment `x *op*= y` is evaluated as either `x = x *op *y` or `x = (T)(x *op *y)`, the rules of evaluation implicitly cover lifted operators.

### Event assignment

If the left operand of a `+=` or `-=` operator is classified as an event access, then the expression is evaluated as follows:

- The instance expression, if any, of the event access is evaluated.
- The right operand of the `+=` or `-=` operator is evaluated, and, if required, converted to the type of the left operand through an implicit conversion (§11.2).
- An event accessor of the event is invoked, with an argument list consisting of the value computed in the previous step. If the operator was `+=`, the add accessor is invoked; if the operator was `-=`, the remove accessor is invoked.

An event assignment expression does not yield a value. Thus, an event assignment expression is valid only in the context of a *statement-expression* (§13.7).

## Expression

An *expression* is either a *non-assignment-expression* or an *assignment*.

```antlr
expression:
    non-assignment-expression
    assignment

non-assignment-expression:
    conditional-expression
    lambda-expression
    query-expression
```

## Constant expressions

A constant expression is an expression that shall be fully evaluated at compile-time.

```antlr
constant-expression:
    expression
```

A constant expression may be either a value type or a reference type. If a constant expression is a value type, it must be one of the following types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, `bool`, or any enumeration type. If a constant expression is a reference type, it must be the `string` type, a default value expression (§12.7.15) for some reference type, or the value of the expression must be `null`.

Only the following constructs are permitted in constant expressions:

- Literals (including the `null` literal).
- References to const members of class and struct types.
- References to members of enumeration types.
- References to const parameters or local variables
- Parenthesized subexpressions, which are themselves constant expressions.
- Cast expressions.
- `checked` and `unchecked` expressions
- The predefined `+`, `–`, `!`, and `~` unary operators.
- The predefined `+`, `–`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` binary operators.
- The `?:` conditional operator.
- `sizeof` expressions, provided the unmanaged-type is one of the types specified in §23.6.9 for which `sizeof` returns a constant value.
- Default value expressions, provided the type is one of the types listed above.

The following conversions are permitted in constant expressions:

- Identity conversions
- Numeric conversions
- Enumeration conversions
- Constant expression conversions
- Implicit and explicit reference conversions, provided the source of the conversions is a constant expression that evaluates to the `null` value.

> [!NOTE]
> Other conversions including boxing, unboxing, and implicit reference conversions of non-null values are not permitted in constant expressions.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class C
{
    const object i = 5; // error: boxing conversion not permitted
    const object str = “hello”; // error: implicit reference conversion
}
```

the initialization of `i` is an error because a boxing conversion is required. The initialization of `str` is an error because an implicit reference conversion from a non-null value is required. *end example*]

Whenever an expression fulfills the requirements listed above, the expression is evaluated at compile-time. This is true even if the expression is a subexpression of a larger expression that contains non-constant constructs.

The compile-time evaluation of constant expressions uses the same rules as run-time evaluation of non-constant expressions, except that where run-time evaluation would have thrown an exception, compile-time evaluation causes a compile-time error to occur.

Unless a constant expression is explicitly placed in an unchecked context, overflows that occur in integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions during the compile-time evaluation of the expression always cause compile-time errors (§12.7.14).

Constant expressions are required in the contexts listed below and this is indicated in the grammar by using *constant-expression*. In these contexts, a compile-time error occurs if an expression cannot be fully evaluated at compile-time.

- Constant declarations (§15.4)
- Enumeration member declarations (§19.4)
- Default arguments of formal parameter lists (§15.6.2)
- `case` labels of a `switch` statement (§13.8.3).
- `goto` case statements (§13.10.4)
- Dimension lengths in an array creation expression (§12.7.11.5) that includes an initializer.
- Attributes (§22)

An implicit constant expression conversion (§11.2.10) permits a constant expression of type `int` to be converted to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `uint`, or `ulong`, provided the value of the constant expression is within the range of the destination type.

## Boolean expressions

A *boolean-expression* is an expression that yields a result of type `bool`; either directly or through application of operator true in certain contexts as specified in the following:

```antlr
boolean-expression:
    expression
```

The controlling conditional expression of an *if-statement* (§13.8.2), *while-statement* (§13.9.2), *do-statement* (§13.9.3), or *for-statement* (§13.9.4) is a *boolean-expression*. The controlling conditional expression of the `?:` operator (§12.15) follows the same rules as a *boolean-expression*, but for reasons of operator precedence is classified as a *conditional-or-expression*.

A *boolean-expression* `E` is required to be able to produce a value of type `bool`, as follows:

- If `E` is implicitly convertible to `bool` then at run-time that implicit conversion is applied.
- Otherwise, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is used to find a unique best implementation of operator true on `E`, and that implementation is applied at run-time.
- If no such operator is found, a binding-time error occurs.

# Statements

## General

C# provides a variety of statements. 

> [!NOTE]
> Most of these statements will be familiar to developers who have programmed in C and C++.

```antlr
statement:
    labeled-statement
    declaration-statement
    embedded-statement

embedded-statement:
    block
    empty-statement
    expression-statement
    selection-statement
    iteration-statement
    jump-statement
    try-statement
    checked-statement
    unchecked-statement
    lock-statement
    using-statement
    yield-statement
```

The *embedded-statement* nonterminal is used for statements that appear within other statements. The use of *embedded-statement* rather than *statement* excludes the use of declaration statements and labeled statements in these contexts. [*Example*: The code

```csharp
void F (bool b)
{
    if (b)
        int i = 44;
}
```

results in a compile-time error because an if statement requires an *embedded-statement* rather than a *statement* for its if branch. If this code were permitted, then the variable `i` would be declared, but it could never be used. Note, however, that by placing `i`’s declaration in a block, the example is valid. *end example*]

## End points and reachability

Every statement has an ***end point***. In intuitive terms, the end point of a statement is the location that immediately follows the statement. The execution rules for composite statements (statements that contain embedded statements) specify the action that is taken when control reaches the end point of an embedded statement. [*Example*: When control reaches the end point of a statement in a block, control is transferred to the next statement in the block. *end example*]

If a statement can possibly be reached by execution, the statement is said to be ***reachable***. Conversely, if there is no possibility that a statement will be executed, the statement is said to be ***unreachable***.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
void F ()
{
    Console.WriteLine ("reachable");
    goto Label;
    Console.WriteLine ("unreachable");
    Label:
        Console.WriteLine ("reachable");
}
```

the second invocation of `Console.WriteLine` is unreachable because there is no possibility that the statement will be executed. *end example*]

A warning is reported if the compiler determines that a statement is unreachable. It is specifically not an error for a statement to be unreachable.

> [!NOTE]
> To determine whether a particular statement or end point is reachable, the compiler performs flow analysis according to the reachability rules defined for each statement. The flow analysis takes into account the values of constant expressions (§12.20) that control the behavior of statements, but the possible values of non-constant expressions are not considered. In other words, for purposes of control flow analysis, a non-constant expression of a given type is considered to have any possible value of that type.
> 
> In the example
> 
> ```csharp
> void F ()
> {
>     const int i = 1;
>     if (i == 2) Console.WriteLine ("unreachable");
> }
> ```
> 
> the `Boolean` expression of the if statement is a constant expression because both operands of the `==` operator are constants. As the constant expression is evaluated at compile-time, producing the value false, the `Console.WriteLine` invocation is considered unreachable. However, if `i` is changed to be a local variable
> 
> ```csharp
> void F ()
> {
>     int i = 1;
>     if (i == 2) Console.WriteLine ("reachable");
> }
> ```
> 
> the `Console.WriteLine` invocation is considered reachable, even though, in reality, it will never be executed.

The *block* of a function member or an anonymous function is always considered reachable. By successively evaluating the reachability rules of each statement in a block, the reachability of any given statement can be determined.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
void F (int x)
{
    Console.WriteLine ("start");
    if (x < 0) Console.WriteLine ("negative");
}
```

the reachability of the second `Console.WriteLine` is determined as follows:

- The first `Console.WriteLine` expression statement is reachable because the block of the `F` method is reachable (§13.3).
- The end point of the first `Console.WriteLine` expression statement is reachable because that statement is reachable (§13.7 and §13.3).
- The `if` statement is reachable because the end point of the first `Console.WriteLine` expression statement is reachable (§13.7 and §13.3).
- The second `Console.WriteLine` expression statement is reachable because the `Boolean` expression of the if statement does not have the constant value false.

*end example*]

There are two situations in which it is a compile-time error for the end point of a statement to be reachable:

- Because the `switch` statement does not permit a `switch` section to “fall through” to the next `switch` section, it is a compile-time error for the end point of the statement list of a `switch` section to be reachable. If this error occurs, it is typically an indication that a `break` statement is missing.
- It is a compile-time error for the end point of the block of a function member or an anonymous function that computes a value to be reachable. If this error occurs, it typically is an indication that a `return` statement is missing (§13.10.5).

## Blocks

### General

A *block* permits multiple statements to be written in contexts where a single statement is allowed.

```antlr
block:
    { statement-listopt }
```

A *block* consists of an optional *statement-list* (§13.3.2), enclosed in braces. If the statement list is omitted, the block is said to be empty.

A block may contain declaration statements (§13.6). The scope of a local variable or constant declared in a block is the block.

Within a block, the meaning of a name used in an expression context shall always be the same (§12.7.3.2).

A block is executed as follows:

- If the block is empty, control is transferred to the end point of the block.
- If the block is not empty, control is transferred to the statement list. When and if control reaches the end point of the statement list, control is transferred to the end point of the block.

The statement list of a block is reachable if the block itself is reachable.

The end point of a block is reachable if the block is empty or if the end point of the statement list is reachable.

A *block* that contains one or more yield statements (§13.15) is called an iterator block. Iterator blocks are used to implement function members as iterators (§15.14). Some additional restrictions apply to iterator blocks:

- It is a compile-time error for a return statement to appear in an iterator block (but `yield return` statements are permitted).
- It is a compile-time error for an iterator block to contain an `unsafe` context (§23.2). An iterator block always defines a safe context, even when its declaration is nested in an `unsafe` context.

### Statement lists

A ***statement list*** consists of one or more statements written in sequence. Statement lists occur in *block*s (§13.3) and in *switch-block*s (§13.8.3).

```antlr
statement-list:
    statement
    statement-list statement
```

A statement list is executed by transferring control to the first statement. When and if control reaches the end point of a statement, control is transferred to the next statement. When and if control reaches the end point of the last statement, control is transferred to the end point of the statement list.

A statement in a statement list is reachable if at least one of the following is true:

- The statement is the first statement and the statement list itself is reachable.
- The end point of the preceding statement is reachable.
- The statement is a labeled statement and the label is referenced by a reachable goto statement.

The end point of a statement list is reachable if the end point of the last statement in the list is reachable.

## The empty statement

An *empty-statement* does nothing.

```antlr
empty-statement:
    ;
```

An empty statement is used when there are no operations to perform in a context where a statement is required.

Execution of an empty statement simply transfers control to the end point of the statement. Thus, the end point of an empty statement is reachable if the empty statement is reachable.

[*Example*: An empty statement can be used when writing a while statement with a null body:

```csharp
bool ProcessMessage () {…}

void ProcessMessages ()
{
    while (ProcessMessage ())
    ;
}
```

Also, an empty statement can be used to declare a label just before the closing “`}`” of a block:

```csharp
void F ()
{
    …

    if (done) goto exit;
    …

    exit: ;
}
```

## Labeled statements

A *labeled-statement* permits a statement to be prefixed by a label. Labeled statements are permitted in blocks, but are not permitted as embedded statements.

```antlr
labeled-statement:
    identifier : statement
```

A labeled statement declares a label with the name given by the *identifier*. The scope of a label is the whole block in which the label is declared, including any nested blocks. It is a compile-time error for two labels with the same name to have overlapping scopes.

A label can be referenced from goto statements (§13.10.4) within the scope of the label. 

> [!NOTE]
> This means that goto statements can transfer control within blocks and out of blocks, but never into blocks.

Labels have their own declaration space and do not interfere with other identifiers. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
int F (int x)
{
    if (x >= 0) goto x;
    x = -x;
    x : return x;
}
```

is valid and uses the name `x` as both a parameter and a label. *end example*]

Execution of a labeled statement corresponds exactly to execution of the statement following the label.

In addition to the reachability provided by normal flow of control, a labeled statement is reachable if the label is referenced by a reachable `goto` statement, unless the `goto` statement is inside the `try` block or a `catch` block of a *try-statement* that includes a `finally` block whose end point is unreachable, and the labeled statement is outside the *try-statement*.

## Declaration statements

### General

A *declaration-statement* declares a local variable or constant. Declaration statements are permitted in blocks, but are not permitted as embedded statements.

```antlr
declaration-statement:
    local-variable-declaration ;
    local-constant-declaration ;
```

### Local variable declarations

A *local-variable-declaration* declares one or more local variables.

```antlr
local-variable-declaration:
    local-variable-type local-variable-declarators

local-variable-type:
    type
    var

local-variable-declarators:
    local-variable-declarator
    local-variable-declarators , local-variable-declarator

local-variable-declarator:
    identifier
    identifier = local-variable-initializer

local-variable-initializer:
    expression
    array-initializer
```

The *local-variable-type* of a *local-variable-declaration* either directly specifies the type of the variables introduced by the declaration, or indicates with the identifier var that the type should be inferred based on an initializer. The type is followed by a list of *local-variable-declarator*s, each of which introduces a new variable. A *local-variable-declarator* consists of an *identifier* that names the variable, optionally followed by an “`=`” token and a *local-variable-initializer* that gives the initial value of the variable.

In the context of a local variable declaration, the identifier `var` acts as a contextual keyword (§7.4.4).When the *local-variable-type* is specified as `var` and no type named `var` is in scope, the declaration is an ***implicitly typed local variable declaration***, whose type is inferred from the type of the associated initializer expression. Implicitly typed local variable declarations are subject to the following restrictions:

- The *local-variable-declaration* cannot include multiple *local-variable-declarator*s.
- The *local-variable-declarator* shall include a *local-variable-initializer*.
- The *local-variable-initializer* shall be an *expression*.
- The initializer *expression* shall have a compile-time type.
- The initializer *expression* cannot refer to the declared variable itself

[*Example*: The following are incorrect implicitly typed local variable declarations:

```csharp
var x; // Error, no initializer to infer type from
var y = { 1, 2, 3 }; // Error, array initializer not permitted
var z = null; // Error, null does not have a type
var u = x => x + 1; // Error, anonymous functions do not have a type
var v = v++; // Error, initializer cannot refer to v itself
```

*end example*]

The value of a local variable is obtained in an expression using a *simple-name* (§12.7.3), and the value of a local variable is modified using an *assignment* (§12.18). A local variable shall be definitely assigned (§10.4) at each location where its value is obtained.

The scope of a local variable declared in a *local-variable-declaration* is the block in which the declaration occurs. It is an error to refer to a local variable in a textual position that precedes the *local-variable-declarator* of the local variable. Within the scope of a local variable, it is a compile-time error to declare another local variable or constant with the same name.

A local variable declaration that declares multiple variables is equivalent to multiple declarations of single variables with the same type. Furthermore, a variable initializer in a local variable declaration corresponds exactly to an assignment statement that is inserted immediately after the declaration.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
void F ()
{
    int x = 1, y, z = x * 2;
}
```

corresponds exactly to

```csharp
void F ()
{
    int x;
    x = 1;
    int y;
    int z;
    z = x * 2;
}
```

*end example*]

In an implicitly typed local variable declaration, the type of the local variable being declared is taken to be the same as the type of the expression used to initialize the variable. [*Example*:

```csharp
var i = 5;
var s = "Hello";
var d = 1.0;
var numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
var orders = new Dictionary<int, Order> ();
```

The implicitly typed local variable declarations above are precisely equivalent to the following explicitly typed declarations:

```csharp
int i = 5;
string s = "Hello";
double d = 1.0;
int[] numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
Dictionary<int, Order> orders = new Dictionary<int, Order> ();
```

*end example*]

### Local constant declarations

A *local-constant-declaration* declares one or more local constants.

```antlr
local-constant-declaration:
    const type constant-declarators

constant-declarators:
    constant-declarator
    constant-declarators , constant-declarator

constant-declarator:
    identifier = constant-expression
```

The *type* of a *local-constant-declaration* specifies the type of the constants introduced by the declaration. The type is followed by a list of *constant-declarator*s, each of which introduces a new constant. A *constant-declarator* consists of an *identifier* that names the constant, followed by an “`=`” token, followed by a *constant-expression* (§12.20) that gives the value of the constant.

The *type* and *constant-expression* of a local constant declaration shall follow the same rules as those of a constant member declaration (§15.4).

The value of a local constant is obtained in an expression using a *simple-name* (§12.7.3).

The scope of a local constant is the block in which the declaration occurs. It is an error to refer to a local constant in a textual position that precedes the end of its *constant-declarator*. Within the scope of a local constant, it is a compile-time error to declare another local variable or constant with the same name.

A local constant declaration that declares multiple constants is equivalent to multiple declarations of single constants with the same type.

## Expression statements

An *expression-statement* evaluates a given expression. The value computed by the expression, if any, is discarded.

```antlr
expression-statement:
    statement-expression ;

statement-expression:
    invocation-expression
    object-creation-expression
    assignment
    post-increment-expression
    post-decrement-expression
    pre-increment-expression
    pre-decrement-expression
    await-expression
```

Not all expressions are permitted as statements. 

> [!NOTE]
> In particular, expressions such as `x + y` and `x == 1`, that merely compute a value (which will be discarded), are not permitted as statements.

Execution of an expression statement evaluates the contained expression and then transfers control to the end point of the expression statement. The end point of an *expression-statement* is reachable if that *expression-statement* is reachable.

## Selection statements

### General

Selection statements select one of a number of possible statements for execution based on the value of some expression.

```antlr
selection-statement:
    if-statement
    switch-statement
```

### The if statement

The `if` statement selects a statement for execution based on the value of a `Boolean` expression.

```antlr
if-statement:
    if ( boolean-expression ) embedded-statement
    if ( boolean-expression ) embedded-statement else embedded-statement
```

An `else` part is associated with the lexically nearest preceding if that is allowed by the syntax. [*Example*: Thus, an `if` statement of the form

```csharp
if (x) if (y) F(); else G();
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
if (x)
{
    if (y)
    {
        F ();
    }
    else
    {
        G ();
    }
}
```

*end example*]

An `if` statement is executed as follows:

- The *boolean-expression* (§12.21) is evaluated.
- If the `Boolean` expression yields `true`, control is transferred to the first embedded statement. When and if control reaches the end point of that statement, control is transferred to the end point of the `if` statement.
- If the `Boolean` expression yields `false` and if an `else` part is present, control is transferred to the second embedded statement. When and if control reaches the end point of that statement, control is transferred to the end point of the `if` statement.
- If the `Boolean` expression yields `false` and if an `else` part is not present, control is transferred to the end point of the `if` statement.

The first embedded statement of an `if` statement is reachable if the `if` statement is reachable and the `Boolean` expression does not have the constant value `false`.

The second embedded statement of an `if` statement, if present, is reachable if the `if` statement is reachable and the `Boolean` expression does not have the constant value `true`.

The end point of an if statement is reachable if the end point of at least one of its embedded statements is reachable. In addition, the end point of an if statement with no else part is reachable if the if statement is reachable and the Boolean expression does not have the constant value true.

### The switch statement

The `switch` statement selects for execution a statement list having an associated `switch` label that corresponds to the value of the `switch` expression.

```antlr
switch-statement:
    switch ( expression ) switch-block

switch-block:
    { switch-sectionsopt }

switch-sections:
    switch-section
    switch-sections switch-section

switch-section:
    switch-labels statement-list

switch-labels:
    switch-label
    switch-labels switch-label

switch-label:
    case constant-expression :
    default :
```

A *switch-statement* consists of the keyword `switch`, followed by a parenthesized expression (called the ***switch expression***), followed by a *switch-block*. The *switch-block* consists of zero or more *switch-section*s, enclosed in braces. Each *switch-section* consists of one or more *switch-labels* followed by a *statement-list* (§13.3.2).

The ***governing type*** of a `switch` statement is established by the `switch` expression.

- If the type of the `switch` expression is `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `bool`, `string`, or an enum-type, or if it is the nullable value type corresponding to one of these types, then that is the governing type of the `switch` statement.
- Otherwise, exactly one user-defined implicit conversion shall exist from the type of the `switch` expression to one of the following possible governing types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `string`, or, a nullable value type corresponding to one of those types.
- Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.

The constant expression of each case label shall denote a value of a type that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the governing type of the `switch` statement. A compile-time error occurs if two or more case labels in the same `switch` statement specify the same constant value.

There can be at most one default label in a `switch` statement.

A `switch` statement is executed as follows:

- The `switch` expression is evaluated and converted to the governing type.
- If one of the constants specified in a case label in the same `switch` statement is equal to the value of the `switch` expression, control is transferred to the statement list following the matched case label.
- If none of the constants specified in case labels in the same `switch` statement is equal to the value of the `switch` expression, and if a default label is present, control is transferred to the statement list following the `default` label.
- If none of the constants specified in case labels in the same `switch` statement is equal to the value of the `switch` expression, and if no `default` label is present, control is transferred to the end point of the `switch` statement.

If the end point of the statement list of a `switch` section is reachable, a compile-time error occurs. This is known as the “no fall through” rule. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
switch (i)
{
    case 0:
        CaseZero ();
        break;
    case 1:
        CaseOne ();
        break;
    default:
        CaseOthers ();
        break;
}
```

is valid because no `switch` section has a reachable end point. Unlike C and C++, execution of a `switch` section is not permitted to “fall through” to the next `switch` section, and the example

```csharp
switch (i)
{
    case 0:
        CaseZero ();
    case 1:
        CaseZeroOrOne ();
    default:
        CaseAny ();
}
```

results in a compile-time error. When execution of a `switch` section is to be followed by execution of another `switch` section, an explicit goto case or goto default statement shall be used:

```csharp
switch (i)
{
    case 0:
        CaseZero ();
        goto case 1;
    case 1:
        CaseZeroOrOne ();
        goto default;
    default:
        CaseAny ();
        break;
}
```

*end example*]

Multiple labels are permitted in a *switch-section*. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
switch (i) {
case 0:
    CaseZero ();
    break;
case 1:
    CaseOne ();
    break;
case 2:
default:
    CaseTwo ();
    break;
    }
```

is valid. The example does not violate the “no fall through” rule because the labels `case 2:` and `default:` are part of the same *switch-section*. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> The “no fall through” rule prevents a common class of bugs that occur in C and C++ when break statements are accidentally omitted. For example, the sections of the switch statement above can be reversed without affecting the behavior of the statement:
> 
> switch (i)
> {
>     default : CaseAny ();
>     break;
>     case 1:
>             CaseZeroOrOne ();
>         goto default;
>     case 0:
>             CaseZero ();
>         goto case 1;
> }
> 

> [!NOTE]
> The statement list of a switch section typically ends in a break, goto case, or goto default statement, but any construct that renders the end point of the statement list unreachable is permitted. For example, a while statement controlled by the Boolean expression true is known to never reach its end point. Likewise, a throw or return statement always transfers control elsewhere and never reaches its end point. Thus, the following example is valid:
> 
> switch (i)
> {
>     case 0:
>         while (true) F ();
>     case 1:
>         throw new ArgumentException ();
>     case 2:
>         return;
> }
> 

[*Example*: The governing type of a switch statement can be the type `string`. For example:

```csharp
void DoCommand (string command)
{
    switch (command.ToLower ())
    {
        case "run":
            DoRun ();
            break;
        case "save":
            DoSave ();
            break;
        case "quit":
            DoQuit ();
            break;
        default:
            InvalidCommand (command);
            break;
    }
}
```

*end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> Like the string equality operators (§12.11.8), the `switch` statement is case sensitive and will execute a given `switch` section only if the `switch` expression string exactly matches a case label constant.

When the governing type of a `switch` statement is `string` or a nullable value type, the value `null` is permitted as a case label constant.

The *statement-list*s of a *switch-block* may contain declaration statements (§13.6). The scope of a local variable or constant declared in a `switch` block is the `switch` block.

Within a `switch` block, the meaning of a name used in an expression context shall always be the same (§12.7.3.2).

The statement list of a given `switch` section is reachable if the `switch` statement is reachable and at least one of the following is `true`:

- The `switch` expression is a non-constant value.
- The `switch` expression is a constant value that matches a case label in the `switch` section.
- The `switch` expression is a constant value that doesn’t match any case label, and the `switch` section contains the `default` label.
- A `switch` label of the `switch` section is referenced by a reachable goto case or goto `default` statement.

The end point of a `switch` statement is reachable if at least one of the following is `true`:

- The `switch` statement contains a reachable break statement that exits the `switch` statement.
- The `switch` statement is reachable, the `switch` expression is a non-constant value, and no `default` label is present.
- The `switch` statement is reachable, the `switch` expression is a constant value that doesn’t match any case label, and no `default` label is present.

## Iteration statements

### General

Iteration statements repeatedly execute an embedded statement.

```antlr
iteration-statement:
    while-statement
    do-statement
    for-statement
    foreach-statement
```

### The while statement

The `while` statement conditionally executes an embedded statement zero or more times.

```antlr
while-statement:
    while ( boolean-expression ) embedded-statement
```

A `while` statement is executed as follows:

- The *boolean-expression* (§12.21) is evaluated.
- If the Boolean expression yields `true`, control is transferred to the embedded statement. When and if control reaches the end point of the embedded statement (possibly from execution of a continue statement), control is transferred to the beginning of the `while` statement.
- If the Boolean expression yields `false`, control is transferred to the end point of the `while` statement.

Within the embedded statement of a `while` statement, a `break` statement (§13.10.2) may be used to transfer control to the end point of the `while` statement (thus ending iteration of the embedded statement), and a `continue` statement (§13.10.3) may be used to transfer control to the end point of the embedded statement (thus performing another iteration of the `while` statement).

The embedded statement of a `while` statement is reachable if the `while` statement is reachable and the Boolean expression does not have the constant value `false`.

The end point of a `while` statement is reachable if at least one of the following is true:

- The `while` statement contains a reachable `break` statement that exits the `while` statement.
- The `while` statement is reachable and the Boolean expression does not have the constant value `true`.

### The do statement

The `do` statement conditionally executes an embedded statement one or more times.

```antlr
do-statement:
    do embedded-statement while ( boolean-expression ) ;
```

A `do` statement is executed as follows:

- Control is transferred to the embedded statement.
- When and if control reaches the end point of the embedded statement (possibly from execution of a `continue` statement), the *boolean-expression* (§12.21) is evaluated. If the Boolean expression yields `true`, control is transferred to the beginning of the `do` statement. Otherwise, control is transferred to the end point of the `do` statement.

Within the embedded statement of a `do` statement, a `break` statement (§13.10.2) may be used to transfer control to the end point of the `do` statement (thus ending iteration of the embedded statement), and a `continue` statement (§13.10.3) may be used to transfer control to the end point of the embedded statement (thus performing another iteration of the `do` statement).

The embedded statement of a `do` statement is reachable if the `do` statement is reachable.

The end point of a `do` statement is reachable if at least one of the following is true:

- The `do` statement contains a reachable `break` statement that exits the `do` statement.
- The end point of the embedded statement is reachable and the Boolean expression does not have the constant value `true`.

### The for statement

The `for` statement evaluates a sequence of initialization expressions and then, while a condition is `true`, repeatedly executes an embedded statement and evaluates a sequence of iteration expressions.

```antlr
for-statement:
    for ( for-initializeropt ; for-conditionopt ; for-iteratoropt ) embedded-statement

for-initializer:
    local-variable-declaration
    statement-expression-list

for-condition:
    boolean-expression

for-iterator:
    statement-expression-list

statement-expression-list:
    statement-expression
    statement-expression-list , statement-expression
```

The *for-initializer*, if present, consists of either a *local-variable-declaration* (§13.6.2) or a list of *statement-expression*s (§13.7) separated by commas. The scope of a local variable declared by a *for-initializer* starts at the *local-variable-declarator* for the variable and extends to the end of the embedded statement. The scope includes the *for-condition* and the *for-iterator*.

The *for-condition*, if present, shall be a *boolean-expression* (§12.21).

The *for-iterator*, if present, consists of a list of *statement-expression*s (§13.7) separated by commas.

A `for` statement is executed as follows:

- If a *for-initializer* is present, the variable initializers or statement expressions are executed in the order they are written. This step is only performed once.
- If a *for-condition* is present, it is evaluated.
- If the *for-condition* is not present or if the evaluation yields `true`, control is transferred to the embedded statement. When and if control reaches the end point of the embedded statement (possibly from execution of a `continue` statement), the expressions of the *for-iterator*, if any, are evaluated in sequence, and then another iteration is performed, starting with evaluation of the *for-condition* in the step above.
- If the *for-condition* is present and the evaluation yields `false`, control is transferred to the end point of the `for` statement.

Within the embedded statement of a `for` statement, a `break` statement (§13.10.2) may be used to transfer control to the end point of the for statement (thus ending iteration of the embedded statement), and a `continue` statement (§13.10.3) may be used to transfer control to the end point of the embedded statement (thus executing the *for-iterator* and performing another iteration of the `for` statement, starting with the *for-condition*).

The embedded statement of a `for` statement is reachable if one of the following is true:

- The `for` statement is reachable and no *for-condition* is present.
- The `for` statement is reachable and a *for-condition* is present and does not have the constant value `false`.

The end point of a `for` statement is reachable if at least one of the following is true:

- The `for` statement contains a reachable `break` statement that exits the `for` statement.
- The `for` statement is reachable and a *for-condition* is present and does not have the constant value `true`.

### The foreach statement

The `foreach` statement enumerates the elements of a collection, executing an embedded statement for each element of the collection.

foreach-statement:
    foreach ( local-variable-type identifier in expression ) embedded-statement

The *local-variable-type* and *identifier* of a foreach statement declare the ***iteration variable*** of the statement. If the `var` identifier is given as the *local-variable-type*, and no type named `var` is in scope, the iteration variable is said to be an ***implicitly typed iteration variable***, and its type is taken to be the element type of the `foreach` statement, as specified below. The iteration variable corresponds to a read-only local variable with a scope that extends over the embedded statement. During execution of a `foreach` statement, the iteration variable represents the collection element for which an iteration is currently being performed. A compile-time error occurs if the embedded statement attempts to modify the iteration variable (via assignment or the `++` and `--` operators) or pass the iteration variable as a `ref` or `out` parameter.

In the following, for brevity, `IEnumerable`, `IEnumerator`, `IEnumerable<T>` and `IEnumerator<T>` refer to the corresponding types in the namespaces `System.Collections` and `System.Collections.Generic`.

The compile-time processing of a `foreach` statement first determines the ***collection type***, ***enumerator type*** and ***element type*** of the expression. This determination proceeds as follows:

- If the type `X` of *expression* is an array type then there is an implicit reference conversion from `X` to the `IEnumerable` interface (since `System.Array` implements this interface). The ***collection type*** is the `IEnumerable` interface, the ***enumerator type*** is the `IEnumerator` interface and the ***element type*** is the element type of the array type `X`.
- If the type `X` of *expression* is `dynamic` then there is an implicit conversion from *expression* to the `IEnumerable` interface (§11.2.9). The ***collection type*** is the `IEnumerable` interface and the ***enumerator type*** is the `IEnumerator` interface. If the `var` identifier is given as the *local-variable-type* then the ***element type*** is `dynamic`, otherwise it is `object`.
- Otherwise, determine whether the type `X` has an appropriate `GetEnumerator` method:
  - Perform member lookup on the type `X` with identifier `GetEnumerator` and no type arguments. If the member lookup does not produce a match, or it produces an ambiguity, or produces a match that is not a method group, check for an enumerable interface as described below. It is recommended that a warning be issued if member lookup produces anything except a method group or no match.
  - Perform overload resolution using the resulting method group and an empty argument list. If overload resolution results in no applicable methods, results in an ambiguity, or results in a single best method but that method is either static or not public, check for an enumerable interface as described below. It is recommended that a warning be issued if overload resolution produces anything except an unambiguous public instance method or no applicable methods.
  - If the return type `E` of the `GetEnumerator` method is not a class, struct or interface type, an error is produced and no further steps are taken.
  - Member lookup is performed on `E` with the identifier `Current` and no type arguments. If the member lookup produces no match, the result is an error, or the result is anything except a public instance property that permits reading, an error is produced and no further steps are taken.
  - Member lookup is performed on `E` with the identifier `MoveNext` and no type arguments. If the member lookup produces no match, the result is an error, or the result is anything except a method group, an error is produced and no further steps are taken.
  - Overload resolution is performed on the method group with an empty argument list. If overload resolution results in no applicable methods, results in an ambiguity, or results in a single best method but that method is either static or not public, or its return type is not `bool`, an error is produced and no further steps are taken.
  - The ***collection type*** is `X`, the ***enumerator type*** is `E`, and the ***element type*** is the type of the `Current` property.
- Otherwise, check for an enumerable interface:
  - If among all the types `Ti` for which there is an implicit conversion from `X` to `IEnumerable<Ti>`, there is a unique type `T` such that `T` is not `dynamic` and for all the other `Ti` there is an implicit conversion from `IEnumerable<T>` to `IEnumerable<Ti>`, then the ***collection type*** is the interface `IEnumerable<T>`, the ***enumerator type*** is the interface `IEnumerator<T>`, and the ***element type*** is `T`.
  - Otherwise, if there is more than one such type `T`, then an error is produced and no further steps are taken.
  - Otherwise, if there is an implicit conversion from `X` to the `System.Collections.IEnumerable` interface, then the ***collection type*** is this interface, the ***enumerator type*** is the interface `System.Collections.IEnumerator`, and the ***element type*** is `object`.
  - Otherwise, an error is produced and no further steps are taken.

The above steps, if successful, unambiguously produce a collection type `C`, enumerator type `E` and element type `T`. A `foreach` statement of the form

```csharp
foreach (V v in x) *embedded-statement*
```

is then expanded to:

```csharp
{
    E e = ((C) (x)).GetEnumerator ();
    try
    {
        while (e.MoveNext ())
        {
            V v = (V) (T) e.Current;
            * embedded - statement *
        }
    }
    finally
    {
        … // Dispose e
    }
}
```

The variable `e` is not visible to or accessible to the expression `x` or the embedded statement or any other source code of the program. The variable `v` is read-only in the embedded statement. If there is not an explicit conversion (§11.2.13) from `T` (the element type) to `V` (the *local-variable-type* in the `foreach` statement), an error is produced and no further steps are taken. 

> [!NOTE]
> If `x` has the value `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown at run-time.

An implementation is permitted to implement a given *foreach-statement* differently; e.g., for performance reasons, as long as the behavior is consistent with the above expansion.

The placement of `v` inside the `while` loop is important for how it is captured (§12.16.6.2) by any anonymous function occurring in the *embedded-statement*.

[*Example*:

```csharp
int[] values = { 7, 9, 13 };
Action f = null;

foreach (var value in values)
{
    if (f == null) f = () => Console.WriteLine ("First value: " + value);
}

f();
```

If `v` in the expanded form were declared outside of the while loop, it would be shared among all iterations, and its value after the `for` loop would be the final value, `13`, which is what the invocation of `f` would print. Instead, because each iteration has its own variable `v`, the one captured by `f` in the first iteration will continue to hold the value `7`, which is what will be printed. (Note that earlier versions of C# declared `v` outside of the `while` loop.) *end example*]

The body of the `finally` block is constructed according to the following steps:

- If there is an implicit conversion from `E` to the `System.IDisposable` interface, then
  - If `E` is a non-nullable value type then the `finally` clause is expanded to the semantic equivalent of:
  ```csharp
  finally
  {
      ((System.IDisposable) e).Dispose ();
  }
  ```
  - Otherwise the `finally` clause is expanded to the semantic equivalent of:
  ```csharp
  finally
  {
      System.IDisposable d = e as System.IDisposable;
      if (d != null) d.Dispose ();
  }
  ```
  except that if `E` is a value type, or a type parameter instantiated to a value type, then the conversion of `e` to `System.IDisposable` shall not cause boxing to occur.
- Otherwise, if `E` is a sealed type, the `finally` clause is expanded to an empty block:
  ```csharp
  finally {
  }
  ``
- Otherwise, the `finally` clause is expanded to:
  ```csharp
   finally
   {
       System.IDisposable d = e as System.IDisposable;
       if (d != null) d.Dispose ();
   }
  ```
  The local variable `d` is not visible to or accessible to any user code. In particular, it does not conflict with any other variable whose scope includes the `finally` block.

The order in which `foreach` traverses the elements of an array, is as follows: For single-dimensional arrays elements are traversed in increasing index order, starting with index `0` and ending with index `Length – 1`. For multi-dimensional arrays, elements are traversed such that the indices of the rightmost dimension are increased first, then the next left dimension, and so on to the left.

[*Example*: The following example prints out each value in a two-dimensional array, in element order:

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        double[, ] values = { { 1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 4.5 },
            { 5.6, 6.7, 7.8, 8.9 }
        };

        foreach (double elementValue in values)
            Console.Write ("{0} ", elementValue);
        Console.WriteLine ();
    }
}
```

The output produced is as follows:

```plaintext
1.2 2.3 3.4 4.5 5.6 6.7 7.8 8.9
```

*end example*]

[*Example*: In the following example

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };
foreach (var n in numbers) Console.WriteLine (n);
```

the type of `n` is inferred to be `int`, the element type of numbers.

*end example*]

## Jump statements

### General

Jump statements unconditionally transfer control.

```antlr
jump-statement:
    break-statement
    continue-statement
    goto-statement
    return-statement
    throw-statement
```

The location to which a jump statement transfers control is called the ***target*** of the jump statement.

When a jump statement occurs within a block, and the target of that jump statement is outside that block, the jump statement is said to ***exit*** the block. While a jump statement can transfer control out of a block, it can never transfer control into a block.

Execution of jump statements is complicated by the presence of intervening `try` statements. In the absence of such `try` statements, a jump statement unconditionally transfers control from the jump statement to its target. In the presence of such intervening `try` statements, execution is more complex. If the jump statement exits one or more `try` blocks with associated `finally` blocks, control is initially transferred to the `finally` block of the innermost `try` statement. When and if control reaches the end point of a `finally` block, control is transferred to the `finally` block of the next enclosing `try` statement. This process is repeated until the `finally` blocks of all intervening try statements have been executed.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                try
                {
                    Console.WriteLine ("Before break");
                    break;
                }
                finally
                {
                    Console.WriteLine ("Innermost finally block");
                }
            }
            finally
            {
                Console.WriteLine ("Outermost finally block");
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine ("After break");
    }
}
```

the `finally` blocks associated with two `try` statements are executed before control is transferred to the target of the jump statement.

The output produced is as follows:

```plaintext
Before break
Innermost finally block
Outermost finally block
After break
```

*end example*]

### The break statement

The `break` statement exits the nearest enclosing `switch`, `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statement.

```antlr
break-statement:
    break ;
```

The target of a `break` statement is the end point of the nearest enclosing `switch`, `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statement. If a `break` statement is not enclosed by a `switch`, `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statement, a compile-time error occurs.

When multiple `switch`, `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statements are nested within each other, a `break` statement applies only to the innermost statement. To transfer control across multiple nesting levels, a `goto` statement (§13.10.4) shall be used.

A `break` statement cannot exit a `finally` block (§13.11). When a `break` statement occurs within a `finally` block, the target of the `break` statement shall be within the same `finally` block; otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

A `break` statement is executed as follows:

- If the `break` statement exits one or more `try` blocks with associated `finally` blocks, control is initially transferred to the `finally` block of the innermost `try` statement. When and if control reaches the end point of a `finally` block, control is transferred to the `finally` block of the next enclosing `try` statement. This process is repeated until the `finally` blocks of all intervening `try` statements have been executed.
- Control is transferred to the target of the `break` statement.

Because a `break` statement unconditionally transfers control elsewhere, the end point of a `break` statement is never reachable.

### The continue statement

The `continue` statement starts a new iteration of the nearest enclosing `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statement.

```antlr
continue-statement:
    continue ;
```

The target of a `continue` statement is the end point of the embedded statement of the nearest enclosing `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statement. If a continue statement is not enclosed by a `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statement, a compile-time error occurs.

When multiple `while`, `do`, `for`, or `foreach` statements are nested within each other, a `continue` statement applies only to the innermost statement. To transfer control across multiple nesting levels, a `goto` statement (§13.10.4) shall be used.

A `continue` statement cannot exit a `finally` block (§13.11). When a `continue` statement occurs within a `finally` block, the target of the `continue` statement shall be within the same `finally` block; otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

A `continue` statement is executed as follows:

- If the `continue` statement exits one or more `try` blocks with associated `finally` blocks, control is initially transferred to the `finally` block of the innermost `try` statement. When and if control reaches the end point of a `finally` block, control is transferred to the `finally` block of the next enclosing `try` statement. This process is repeated until the `finally` blocks of all intervening `try` statements have been executed.
- Control is transferred to the target of the `continue` statement.

Because a `continue` statement unconditionally transfers control elsewhere, the end point of a `continue` statement is never reachable.

### The goto statement

The `goto` statement transfers control to a statement that is marked by a label.

```antlr
goto-statement:
    goto identifier ;
    goto case constant-expression ;
    goto default ;
```

The target of a `goto` *identifier* statement is the labeled statement with the given label. If a label with the given name does not exist in the current function member, or if the `goto` statement is not within the scope of the label, a compile-time error occurs. 

> [!NOTE]
> This rule permits the use of a `goto` statement to transfer control *out of* a nested scope, but not *into* a nested scope. In the example
> 
> ```csharp
> using System;
> 
> class Test
> {
>     static void Main (string[] args)
>     {
>         string[, ] table = { { "Red", "Blue", "Green" },
>             { "Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday" }
>         };
> 
>         foreach (string str in args)
>         {
>             int row, colm;
>             for (row = 0; row <= 1; ++row)
>                 for (colm = 0; colm <= 2; ++colm)
>                     if (str == table[row, colm])
>                         goto done;
> 
>             Console.WriteLine ("{0} not found", str);
>             continue;
>             done:
>                 Console.WriteLine ("Found {0} at [{1}][{2}]", str, row, colm);
>         }
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> a `goto` statement is used to transfer control out of a nested scope. 

The target of a `goto` case statement is the statement list in the immediately enclosing `switch` statement (§13.8.3) which contains a case label with the given constant value. If the `goto` case statement is not enclosed by a `switch` statement, if the *constant-expression* is not implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the governing type of the nearest enclosing `switch` statement, or if the nearest enclosing `switch` statement does not contain a `case` label with the given constant value, a compile-time error occurs.

The target of a `goto` default statement is the statement list in the immediately enclosing `switch` statement (§13.8.3), which contains a default label. If the `goto` default statement is not enclosed by a `switch` statement, or if the nearest enclosing `switch` statement does not contain a `default` label, a compile-time error occurs.

A `goto` statement cannot exit a `finally` block (§13.11). When a `goto` statement occurs within a `finally` block, the target of the `goto` statement shall be within the same `finally` block, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

A `goto` statement is executed as follows:

- If the `goto` statement exits one or more `try` blocks with associated `finally` blocks, control is initially transferred to the `finally` block of the innermost `try` statement. When and if control reaches the end point of a `finally` block, control is transferred to the `finally` block of the next enclosing `try` statement. This process is repeated until the `finally` blocks of all intervening `try` statements have been executed.
- Control is transferred to the target of the `goto` statement.

Because a `goto` statement unconditionally transfers control elsewhere, the end point of a `goto` statement is never reachable.

### The return statement

The `return` statement returns control to the current caller of the function member in which the `return` statement appears.

```antlr
return-statement:
    return expressionopt ;
```

A function member is said to ***compute a value*** if it is a method with a non-void result type (§15.6.11), the get accessor of a property or indexer, or a user-defined operator. Function members that do not compute a value are methods with the effective return type `void`, set accessors of properties and indexers, add and remove accessors of event, instance constructors, static constructors and finalizers.

Within a function member, a `return` statement with no expression can only be used if the function member does not compute a value. Within a function member, a `return` statement with an expression can only be used if the function member computes a value. Where the `return` statement includes an expression, an implicit conversion (§11.2) shall exist from the type of the expression to the effective `return` type of the containing function member.

`Return` statements can also be used in the body of anonymous function expressions (§12.16), and participate in determining which conversions exist for those functions (§11.7.1).

It is a compile-time error for a `return` statement to appear in a `finally` block (§13.11).

A `return` statement is executed as follows:

- If the `return` statement specifies an expression, the expression is evaluated and its value is converted to the effective `return` type of the containing function by an implicit conversion. The result of the conversion becomes the result value produced by the function.
- If the `return` statement is enclosed by one or more `try` or `catch` blocks with associated `finally` blocks, control is initially transferred to the `finally` block of the innermost `try` statement. When and if control reaches the end point of a `finally` block, control is transferred to the `finally` block of the next enclosing `try` statement. This process is repeated until the `finally` blocks of all enclosing `try` statements have been executed.
- If the containing function is not an `async` function, control is returned to the caller of the containing function along with the result value, if any.
- If the containing function is an `async` function, control is returned to the current caller, and the result value, if any, is recorded in the return task as described in (§15.15.2).

Because a `return` statement unconditionally transfers control elsewhere, the end point of a `return` statement is never reachable.

### The throw statement

The `throw` statement throws an exception.

```antlr
throw-statement:
    throw expressionopt ;
```

A `throw` statement with an expression throws an exception produced by evaluating the expression. The expression shall be implicitly convertible to `System.Exception`, and the result of evaluating the expression is converted to `System.Exception` before being thrown. If the result of the conversion is `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown instead.

A `throw` statement with no expression can be used only in a `catch` block, in which case, that statement re-throws the exception that is currently being handled by that `catch` block.

Because a `throw` statement unconditionally transfers control elsewhere, the end point of a `throw` statement is never reachable.

When an exception is thrown, control is transferred to the first `catch` clause in an enclosing `try` statement that can handle the exception. The process that takes place from the point of the exception being thrown to the point of transferring control to a suitable exception handler is known as ***exception propagation***. Propagation of an exception consists of repeatedly evaluating the following steps until a `catch` clause that matches the exception is found. In this description, the ***throw point*** is initially the location at which the exception is thrown.

- In the current function member, each `try` statement that encloses the throw point is examined. For each statement `S`, starting with the innermost `try` statement and ending with the outermost `try` statement, the following steps are evaluated:
  - If the `try` block of `S` encloses the throw point and if `S` has one or more `catch` clauses, the `catch` clauses are examined in order of appearance to locate a suitable handler for the exception. The first `catch` clause that specifies an exception type `T` (or a type parameter that at run-time denotes an exception type `T`) such that the run-time type of `E` derives from `T` is considered a match. A general catch (§13.11) clause is considered a match for any exception type. If a matching `catch` clause is located, the exception propagation is completed by transferring control to the block of that `catch` clause.
  - Otherwise, if the `try` block or a `catch` block of `S` encloses the throw point and if `S` has a `finally` block, control is transferred to the `finally` block. If the `finally` block throws another exception, processing of the current exception is terminated. Otherwise, when control reaches the end point of the `finally` block, processing of the current exception is continued.
- If an exception handler was not located in the current function invocation, the function invocation is terminated, and one of the following occurs:
  - If the current function is non-async, the steps above are repeated for the caller of the function with a throw point corresponding to the statement from which the function member was invoked.
  - If the current function is `async` and task-returning, the exception is recorded in the return task, which is put into a faulted or cancelled state as described in §15.15.2.
  - If the current function is `async` and void-returning, the synchronization context of the current thread is notified as described in §15.15.3.
- If the exception processing terminates all function member invocations in the current thread, indicating that the thread has no handler for the exception, then the thread is itself terminated. The impact of such termination is implementation-defined.

## The try statement

The `try` statement provides a mechanism for catching exceptions that occur during execution of a block. Furthermore, the `try` statement provides the ability to specify a block of code that is always executed when control leaves the `try` statement.

```antlr
try-statement:
    try block catch-clauses
    try block catch-clausesopt finally-clause

catch-clauses:
    specific-catch-clauses
    specific-catch-clausesopt general-catch-clause

specific-catch-clauses:
    specific-catch-clause
    specific-catch-clauses specific-catch-clause

specific-catch-clause:
    catch ( type identifieropt ) block

general-catch-clause:
    catch block

finally-clause:
    finally block
```

There are three possible forms of `try` statements:

- A `try` block followed by one or more `catch` blocks.
- A `try` block followed by a `finally` block.
- A `try` block followed by one or more `catch` blocks followed by a `finally` block.

When a `catch` clause specifies a *type*, the type shall be `System.Exception` or a type that derives from `System.Exception`. When a `catch` clause specifies a *type-parameter* it shall be a type parameter type whose effective base class is or derives from `System.Exception`.

When a `catch` clause specifies both a *class-type* and an *identifier*, an ***exception variable*** of the given name and type is declared. The exception variable corresponds to a local variable with a scope that extends over the `catch` block. During execution of the `catch` block, the exception variable represents the exception currently being handled. For purposes of definite assignment checking, the exception variable is considered definitely assigned in its entire scope.

Unless a `catch` clause includes an exception variable name, it is impossible to access the exception object in the `catch` block.

A `catch` clause that specifies neither an exception type nor an exception variable name is called a general `catch` clause. A `try` statement can only have one general `catch` clause, and, if one is present, it shall be the last `catch` clause.

> [!NOTE]
> Some programming languages might support exceptions that are not representable as an object derived from `System.Exception`, although such exceptions could never be generated by C# code. A general `catch` clause might be used to catch such exceptions. Thus, a general `catch` clause is semantically different from one that specifies the type `System.Exception`, in that the former might also `catch` exceptions from other languages. 

In order to locate a handler for an exception, `catch` clauses are examined in lexical order. A compile-time error occurs if a `catch` clause specifies a type that is the same as, or is derived from, a type that was specified in an earlier `catch` clause for the same `try`. 

> [!NOTE]
> Without this restriction, it would be possible to write unreachable `catch` clauses.

Within a `catch` block, a `throw` statement (§13.10.6) with no expression can be used to re-throw the exception that was caught by the `catch` block. Assignments to an exception variable do not alter the exception that is re-thrown.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void F ()
    {
        try
        {
            G ();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine ("Exception in F: " + e.Message);
            e = new Exception ("F");
            throw; // re-throw
        }
    }

    static void G ()
    {
        throw new Exception ("G");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            F ();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine ("Exception in Main: " + e.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

the method `F` catches an exception, writes some diagnostic information to the console, alters the exception variable, and re-throws the exception. The exception that is re-thrown is the original exception, so the output produced is:

```plaintext
Exception in F: G
Exception in Main: G
```

If the first `catch` block had thrown `e` instead of rethrowing the current exception, the output produced would be as follows:

```plaintext
Exception in F: G
Exception in Main: F
```

*end example*]

It is a compile-time error for a `break`, `continue`, or `goto` statement to transfer control out of a `finally` block. When a `break`, `continue`, or `goto` statement occurs in a `finally` block, the target of the statement shall be within the same `finally` block, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

It is a compile-time error for a `return` statement to occur in a `finally` block.

A `try` statement is executed as follows:

- Control is transferred to the `try` block.
- When and if control reaches the end point of the `try` block:
  - If the `try` statement has a `finally` block, the `finally` block is executed.
  - Control is transferred to the end point of the `try` statement.
- If an exception is propagated to the `try` statement during execution of the `try` block:
  - The `catch` clauses, if any, are examined in order of appearance to locate a suitable handler for the exception. The first `catch` clause that specifies the exception type or a base type of the exception type is considered a match. A general `catch` clause is considered a match for any exception type. If a matching `catch` clause is located:
    - If the matching `catch` clause declares an exception variable, the exception object is assigned to the exception variable.
    - Control is transferred to the matching `catch` block.
    - When and if control reaches the end point of the `catch` block:
  - If the `try` statement has a `finally` block, the `finally` block is executed.
  - Control is transferred to the end point of the `try` statement.
- If an exception is propagated to the `try` statement during execution of the `catch` block:
  - If the `try` statement has a `finally` block, the `finally` block is executed.
  - The exception is propagated to the next enclosing `try` statement.
- If the `try` statement has no `catch` clauses or if no `catch` clause matches the exception:
  - If the `try` statement has a `finally` block, the `finally` block is executed.
  - The exception is propagated to the next enclosing `try` statement.

The statements of a `finally` block are always executed when control leaves a `try` statement. This is true whether the control transfer occurs as a result of normal execution, as a result of executing a `break`, `continue`, `goto`, or `return` statement, or as a result of propagating an exception out of the `try` statement.

If an exception is thrown during execution of a `finally` block, and is not caught within the same `finally` block,the exception is propagated to the next enclosing `try` statement. If another exception was in the process of being propagated, that exception is lost. The process of propagating an exception is discussed further in the description of the `throw` statement (§13.10.6).

The `try` block of a `try` statement is reachable if the `try` statement is reachable.

A `catch` block of a `try` statement is reachable if the `try` statement is reachable.

The `finally` block of a `try` statement is reachable if the `try` statement is reachable.

The end point of a `try` statement is reachable if both of the following are true:

- The end point of the `try` block is reachable or the end point of at least one `catch` block is reachable.
- If a `finally` block is present, the end point of the `finally` block is reachable.

## The checked and unchecked statements

The `checked` and `unchecked` statements are used to control the ***overflow-checking context*** for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.

```antlr
checked-statement:
    checked block

unchecked-statement:
    unchecked block
```

The `checked` statement causes all expressions in the *block* to be evaluated in a `checked` context, and the `unchecked` statement causes all expressions in the *block* to be evaluated in an `unchecked` context.

The `checked` and `unchecked` statements are precisely equivalent to the `checked` and `unchecked` operators (§12.7.14), except that they operate on blocks instead of expressions.

## The lock statement

The `lock` statement obtains the mutual-exclusion `lock` for a given object, executes a statement, and then releases the `lock`.

```antlr
lock-statement:
    lock ( expression ) embedded-statement
```

The expression of a `lock` statement shall denote a value of a type known to be a *reference*. No implicit boxing conversion (§11.2.8) is ever performed for the expression of a `lock` statement, and thus it is a compile-time error for the expression to denote a value of a *value-type*.

A `lock` statement of the form

```csharp
lock (x) …
```

where `x` is an expression of a *reference-type*, is precisely equivalent to:

```csharp
bool __lockWasTaken = false;
try
{
    System.Threading.Monitor.Enter (x, ref __lockWasTaken);
    …
}
finally
{
    if (__lockWasTaken) System.Threading.Monitor.Exit (x);
}
```

except that `x` is only evaluated once.

While a mutual-exclusion lock is held, code executing in the same execution thread can also obtain and release the lock. However, code executing in other threads is blocked from obtaining the lock until the lock is released.

## The using statement

The `using` statement obtains one or more resources, executes a statement, and then disposes of the resource.

```antlr
using-statement:
    using ( resource-acquisition ) embedded-statement

resource-acquisition:
    local-variable-declaration
    expression
```

A ***resource*** is a class or struct that implements the `System.IDisposable` interface, which includes a single parameterless method named Dispose. Code that is using a resource can call `Dispose` to indicate that the resource is no longer needed.

If the form of *resource-acquisition* is *local-variable-declaration* then the type of the *local-variable-declaration* shall be either `dynamic` or a type that can be implicitly converted to `System.IDisposable`. If the form of *resource-acquisition* is *expression* then this expression shall be implicitly convertible to `System.IDisposable`.

Local variables declared in a *resource-acquisition* are read-only, and shall include an initializer. A compile-time error occurs if the embedded statement attempts to modify these local variables (via assignment or the `++` and `--` operators), take the address of them, or pass them as `ref` or `out` parameters.

A `using` statement is translated into three parts: acquisition, usage, and disposal. Usage of the resource is implicitly enclosed in a `try` statement that includes a `finally` clause. This `finally` clause disposes of the resource. If a null resource is acquired, then no call to `Dispose` is made, and no exception is thrown. If the resource is of type `dynamic` it is dynamically converted through an implicit dynamic conversion (§11.2.9) to `IDisposable` during acquisition in order to ensure that the conversion is successful before the usage and disposal.

A `using` statement of the form

```csharp
using (ResourceType resource = expression) statement
```

corresponds to one of three possible expansions. When `ResourceType` is a non-nullable value type or a type parameter with the value type constraint (§15.2.5), the expansion is semantically equivalent to

```csharp
{
    ResourceType resource = expression;

    try
    {
        statement;
    }

    finally
    {
        ((IDisposable) resource).Dispose ();
    }
}
```

except that the cast of resource to `System.IDisposable` shall not cause boxing to occur.

Otherwise, when `ResourceType` is `dynamic`, the expansion is

```csharp
{
    ResourceType resource = expression;
    IDisposable d = resource;

    try
    {
        statement;
    }

    finally
    {
        if (d != null) d.Dispose ();
    }
}
```

Otherwise, the expansion is

```csharp
{
    ResourceType resource = expression;

    try
    {
        statement;
    }

    finally
    {
        IDisposable d = (IDisposable) resource;
        if (d != null) d.Dispose ();
    }
}
```

In any expansion, the resource variable is read-only in the embedded statement, and the `d` variable is inaccessible in, and invisible to, the embedded statement.

An implementation is permitted to implement a given using-statement differently, e.g., for performance reasons, as long as the behavior is consistent with the above expansion.

A `using` statement of the form:

```csharp
using (expression) statement
```

has the same three possible expansions. In this case `ResourceType` is implicitly the compile-time type of the expression, if it has one. Otherwise the interface `IDisposable` itself is used as the `ResourceType`. The resource variable is inaccessible in, and invisible to, the embedded statement.

When a *resource-acquisition* takes the form of a *local-variable-declaration*, it is possible to acquire multiple resources of a given type. A `using` statement of the form

```csharp
using (ResourceType r1 = e1, r2 = e2, …, rN = eN) statement
```

is precisely equivalent to a sequence of nested `using` statements:

```csharp
using (ResourceType r1 = e1)
using (ResourceType r2 = e2)
…
using (ResourceType rN = eN)
statement
```

[*Example*: The example below creates a file named log.txt and writes two lines of text to the file. The example then opens that same file for reading and copies the contained lines of text to the console.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        using (TextWriter w = File.CreateText ("log.txt"))
        {
            w.WriteLine ("This is line one");
            w.WriteLine ("This is line two");
        }

        using (TextReader r = File.OpenText ("log.txt"))
        {
            string s;
            while ((s = r.ReadLine ()) != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine (s);
            }

        }
    }
}
```

Since the `TextWriter` and `TextReader` classes implement the `IDisposable` interface, the example can use using statements to ensure that the underlying file is properly closed following the write or read operations. *end example*]

## The yield statement

The `yield` statement is used in an iterator block (§13.3) to yield a value to the enumerator object (§15.14.5) or enumerable object (§15.14.6) of an iterator or to signal the end of the iteration.

```antlr
yield-statement:
    yield return expression ;
    yield break ;
```

`yield` is a contextual keyword (§7.4.4) and has special meaning only when used immediately before a `return` or `break` keyword.

There are several restrictions on where a `yield` statement can appear, as described in the following.

- It is a compile-time error for a `yield` statement (of either form) to appear outside a *method-body*, *operator-body*, or *accessor-body*.
- It is a compile-time error for a `yield` statement (of either form) to appear inside an anonymous function.
- It is a compile-time error for a `yield` statement (of either form) to appear in the `finally` clause of a `try` statement.
- It is a compile-time error for a `yield` return statement to appear anywhere in a `try` statement that contains any *catch-clauses*.

[*Example*: The following example shows some valid and invalid uses of `yield` statements.

```csharp
delegate IEnumerable<int> D ();

IEnumerator<int> GetEnumerator ()
{
    try
    {
        yield return 1; // Ok
        yield break; // Ok
    }
    finally
    {
        yield return 2; // Error, yield in finally
        yield break; // Error, yield in finally
    }

    try
    {
        yield return 3; // Error, yield return in try/catch
        yield break; // Ok
    }
    catch
    {
        yield return 4; // Error, yield return in try/catch
        yield break; // Ok
    }

    D d = delegate
    {
        yield return 5; // Error, yield in an anonymous function
    };
}

int MyMethod ()
{
    yield return 1; // Error, wrong return type for an
    // iterator block
}
```

*end example*]

An implicit conversion (§11.2) shall exist from the type of the expression in the `yield` return statement to the `yield` type (§15.14.4) of the iterator.

A `yield` return statement is executed as follows:

- The expression given in the statement is evaluated, implicitly converted to the yield type, and assigned to the `Current` property of the enumerator object.
- Execution of the iterator block is suspended. If the `yield` return statement is within one or more `try` blocks, the associated finally blocks are *not* executed at this time.
- The `MoveNext` method of the enumerator object returns `true` to its caller, indicating that the enumerator object successfully advanced to the next item.

The next call to the enumerator object’s `MoveNext` method resumes execution of the iterator block from where it was last suspended.

A `yield break` statement is executed as follows:

- If the `yield break` statement is enclosed by one or more `try` blocks with associated `finally` blocks, control is initially transferred to the `finally` block of the innermost `try` statement. When and if control reaches the end point of a `finally` block, control is transferred to the `finally` block of the next enclosing `try` statement. This process is repeated until the `finally` blocks of all enclosing `try` statements have been executed.
- Control is returned to the caller of the iterator block. This is either the `MoveNext` method or `Dispose` method of the enumerator object.

Because a `yield break `statement unconditionally transfers control elsewhere, the end point of a `yield break` statement is never reachable.

# Namespaces

## General

C# programs are organized using namespaces. Namespaces are used both as an “internal” organization system for a program, and as an “external” organization system—a way of presenting program elements that are exposed to other programs.

Using directives (§14.5) are provided to facilitate the use of namespaces.

## Compilation units

A *compilation-unit* defines the overall structure of a source file. A compilation unit consists of zero or more *extern-alias-directive*s followed by zero or more *using-directive*s followed by zero or more *global-attributes* followed by zero or more *namespace-member-declaration*s.

```antlr
compilation-unit:
    extern-alias-directivesopt using-directivesopt global-attributesopt
    namespace-member-declarationsopt
```

A C# program consists of one or more compilation units, each contained in a separate source file. When a C# program is compiled, all of the compilation units are processed together. Thus, compilation units can depend on each other, possibly in a circular fashion.

The *extern-alias-directives* of a compilation unit affect the *using-directives*, *global-attributes* and *namespace-member-declarations* of that compilation unit, but have no effect on other compilation units.

The *using-directives* of a compilation unit affect the *global-attributes* and *namespace-member-declarations* of that compilation unit, but have no effect on other compilation units.

The *global-attributes* (§22.3) of a compilation unit permit the specification of attributes for the target assembly and module. Assemblies and modules act as physical containers for types. An assembly may consist of several physically separate modules.

The *namespace-member-declarations* of each compilation unit of a program contribute members to a single declaration space called the global namespace. [*Example*:

```csharp
File A.cs:

class A {}

File B.cs:

class B {}
```

The two compilation units contribute to the single global namespace, in this case declaring two classes with the fully qualified names `A` and `B`. Because the two compilation units contribute to the same declaration space, it would have been an error if each contained a declaration of a member with the same name. *end example*]

## Namespace declarations

A *namespace-declaration* consists of the keyword `namespace`, followed by a namespace name and body, optionally followed by a semicolon.

```antlr
namespace-declaration:
    namespace qualified-identifier namespace-body ;opt

qualified-identifier:
    identifier
    qualified-identifier . identifier

namespace-body:
    { extern-alias-directivesopt using-directivesopt namespace-member-declarationsopt }
```

A *namespace-declaration* may occur as a top-level declaration in a *compilation-unit* or as a member declaration within another *namespace-declaration*. When a *namespace-declaration* occurs as a top-level declaration in a *compilation-unit*, the namespace becomes a member of the global namespace. When a *namespace-declaration* occurs within another *namespace-declaration*, the inner namespace becomes a member of the outer namespace. In either case, the name of a namespace shall be unique within the containing namespace.

Namespaces are implicitly public and the declaration of a namespace cannot include any access modifiers.

Within a *namespace-body*, the optional *using-directives* import the names of other namespaces and types, allowing them to be referenced directly instead of through qualified names. The optional *namespace-member-declarations* contribute members to the declaration space of the namespace.

The *qualified-identifier* of a *namespace-declaration* may be a single identifier or a sequence of identifiers separated by “.” tokens. The latter form permits a program to define a nested namespace without lexically nesting several namespace declarations. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class A { }

    class B { }
}
```

is semantically equivalent to

```csharp
namespace N1
{
    namespace N2
    {
        class A { }

        class B { }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

Namespaces are open-ended, and two namespace declarations with the same fully qualified name (§8.8.2) contribute to the same declaration space (§8.3). [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class A { }
}

namespace N1.N2
{
    class B { }
}
```

the two namespace declarations above contribute to the same declaration space, in this case declaring two classes with the fully qualified names `N1.N2.A` and `N1.N2.B`. Because the two declarations contribute to the same declaration space, it would have been an error if each contained a declaration of a member with the same name. *end example*]

## Extern alias directives

An *extern-alias-directive* introduces an identifier that serves as an alias for a namespace. The specification of the aliased namespace is external to the source code of the program and applies also to nested namespaces of the aliased namespace.

```antlr
extern-alias-directives:
    extern-alias-directive
    extern-alias-directives extern-alias-directive

extern-alias-directive:
    extern alias identifier ;
```

The scope of an *extern-alias-directive* extends over the *using-directives*, *global-attributes* and *namespace-member-declarations* of its immediately containing *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body*.

Within a compilation unit or namespace body that contains an *extern-alias-directive*, the identifier introduced by the *extern-alias-directive* can be used to reference the aliased namespace. It is a compile-time error for the *identifier* to be the word `global`.

Within C# source code, a type is declared a member of a single namespace. However, a namespace hierarchy referenced by an extern alias may contain types that are also members of other namespaces. For example, if `A` and `B` are extern aliases, the names `A::X`, `B::C.Y` and `global::D.Z` may, depending on the external specification supported by the particular compiler, all refer to the same type.

The alias introduced by an *extern-alias-directive* is very similar to the alias introduced by a *using-alias-directive*. See §14.5.2 for more detailed discussion of *extern-alias-directive*s and *using-alias-directive*s.

`alias` is a contextual keyword (§7.4.4) and only has special meaning when it immediately follows the `extern` keyword in an *extern-alias-directive*. [*Example*: In fact an `extern alias` could use the identifier `alias` as its name:

```csharp
extern alias alias;
```

*end example*]

## Using directives

### General

***Using directives*** facilitate the use of namespaces and types defined in other namespaces. Using directives impact the name resolution process of *namespace-or-type-name*s (§8.8) and *simple-name*s (§12.7.3), but unlike declarations, *using-directives* do not contribute new members to the underlying declaration spaces of the compilation units or namespaces within which they are used.

```antlr
using-directives:
    using-directive
    using-directives using-directive

using-directive:
    using-alias-directive
    using-namespace-directive
```

A *using-alias-directive* (§14.5.2) introduces an alias for a namespace or type.

A *using-namespace-directive* (§14.5.3) imports the type members of a namespace.

The scope of a *using-directive* extends over the *namespace-member-declarations* of its immediately containing compilation unit or namespace body. The scope of a *using-directive* specifically does not include its peer *using-directive*s. Thus, peer *using-directive*s do not affect each other, and the order in which they are written is insignificant. In contrast, the scope of an *extern-alias-directive* includes the *using-directives* defined in the same compilation unit or namespace body.

### Using alias directives

A *using-alias-directive* introduces an identifier that serves as an alias for a namespace or type within the immediately enclosing compilation unit or namespace body.

```antlr
using-alias-directive:
    using identifier = namespace-or-type-name ;
```

Within global attributes and member declarations in a compilation unit or namespace body that contains a *using-alias-directive*, the identifier introduced by the *using-alias-directive* can be used to reference the given namespace or type. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class A { }
}

namespace N3
{
    using A = N1.N2.A;

    class B : A { }
}
```

Above, within member declarations in the `N3` namespace, `A` is an alias for `N1.N2.A`, and thus class `N3.B` derives from class `N1.N2.A`. The same effect can be obtained by creating an alias `R` for `N1.N2` and then referencing `R.A`:

```csharp
namespace N3
{
    using R = N1.N2;

    class B : R.A { }
}
```

*end example*]

Within using directives, global attributes and member declarations in a compilation unit or namespace body that contains an *extern-alias-directive*, the identifier introduced by the *extern-alias-directive* can be used to reference the associated namespace. [*Example*: For example:

```csharp
namespace N1
{
    extern alias N2;

    class B : N2::A { }
}
```

Above, within member declarations in the `N1` namespace, `N2` is an alias for some namespace whose definition is external to the source code of the program. Class `N1.B` derives from class `N2.A`. The same effect can be obtained by creating an alias `A` for `N2.A` and then referencing `A`:

```csharp
namespace N1
{
    extern alias N2;
    using A = N2::A;

    class B : A { }
}
```

*end example*]

An *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* makes an alias available within a particular compilation unit or namespace body, but it does not contribute any new members to the underlying declaration space. In other words, an alias directive is not transitive, but, rather, affects only the compilation unit or namespace body in which it occurs. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
namespace N3
{
    extern alias R1;
    using R2 = N1.N2;
}

namespace N3
{
    class B : R1::A, R2.I { } // Error, R1 and R2 unknown
}
```

the scopes of the alias directives that introduce `R1` and `R2` only extend to member declarations in the namespace body in which they are contained, so `R1` and `R2` are unknown in the second namespace declaration. However, placing the alias directives in the containing compilation unit causes the alias to become available within both namespace declarations:

```csharp
extern alias R1;
using R2 = N1.N2;

namespace N3
{
    class B : R1::A, R2.I { }
}

namespace N3
{
    class C : R1::A, R2.I { }
}
```

*end example*]

Each *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* in a *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body* contributes a name to the ***alias declaration space*** (§8.3) of the immediately enclosing *compilation-unit* or *namespace-body*. The *identifier* of the alias directive shall be unique within the corresponding alias declaration space. The alias identifier need not be unique within the global declaration space or the declaration space of the corresponding namespace. [*Example*:

```csharp
extern alias A;
extern alias B;

using A = N1.N2; // Error: alias A already exists

class B {} // Ok
```

The `using` alias named `A` causes an error since there is already an alias named `A` in the same compilation unit. The class named `B` does not conflict with the `extern alias` named `B` since these names are added to distinct declaration spaces. The former is added to the global declaration space and the latter is added to the alias declaration space for this compilation unit.

When an alias name matches the name of a member of a namespace, usage of either must be appropriately qualified:

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class B { }
}

namespace N3
{
    class A { }
    class B : A { }
}

namespace N3
{
    using A = N1.N2;
    using B = N1.N2.B;

    class W : B { } // Error: B is ambiguous
    class X : A.B { } // Error: A is ambiguous
    class Y : A::B { } // Ok: uses N1.N2.B
    class Z : N3.B { } // Ok: uses N3.B
}
```

In the second namespace body for `N3`, unqualified use of `B` results in an error, since `N3` contains a member named `B` and the namespace body that also declares an alias with name `B`; likewise for `A`. The class `N3.B` can be referenced as `N3.B` or `global::N3.B`. The alias `A` can be used in a *qualified-alias-member* (§14.8), such as `A::B`. The alias `B` is essentially useless. It cannot be used in a *qualified-alias-member* since only namespace aliases can be used in a *qualified-alias-member* and B aliases a type. *end example*]

Just like regular members, names introduced by *alias-directives* are hidden by similarly named members in nested scopes. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using R = N1.N2;

namespace N3
{
    class R { }

    class B : R.A { } // Error, R has no member A
}
```

the reference to `R.A` in the declaration of `B` causes a compile-time error because `R` refers to `N3.R`, not `N1.N2`. *end example*]

The order in which *extern-alias-directive*s are written has no significance. Likewise, the order in which *using-alias-directive*s are written has no significance, but all *using-alias-directives* must come after all *extern-alias-directives* in the same compilation unit or namespace body. Resolution of the *namespace-or-type-name* referenced by a *using-alias-directive* is not affected by the *using-alias-directive* itself or by other *using-directive*s in the immediately containing compilation unit or namespace body, but may be affected by *extern-alias-directives* in the immediately containing compilation unit or namespace body. In other words, the *namespace-or-type-name* of a *using-alias-directive* is resolved as if the immediately containing compilation unit or namespace body had no *using-directive*s but has the correct set of *extern-alias-directive*s. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
namespace N1.N2 { }

namespace N3
{
    extern alias E;

    using R1 = E::N; // OK

    using R2 = N1; // OK

    using R3 = N1.N2; // OK

    using R4 = R2.N2; // Error, R2 unknown
}
```

the last *using-alias-directive* results in a compile-time error because it is not affected by the previous *using-alias-directive*. The first *using-alias-directive* does not result in an error since the scope of the `extern alias E` includes the *using-alias-directive*. *end example*]

A *using-alias-directive* can create an alias for any namespace or type, including the namespace within which it appears and any namespace or type nested within that namespace.

Accessing a namespace or type through an alias yields exactly the same result as accessing that namespace or type through its declared name. [*Example*: Given

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class A { }
}

namespace N3
{
    using R1 = N1;
    using R2 = N1.N2;

    class B
    {
        N1.N2.A a; // refers to N1.N2.A
        R1.N2.A b; // refers to N1.N2.A
        R2.A c; // refers to N1.N2.A
    }
}
```

the names `N1.N2.A`, `R1.N2.A`, and `R2.A` are equivalent and all refer to the class declaration whose fully qualified name is `N1.N2.A`. *end example*]

Although each part of a partial type (§15.2.7) is declared within the same namespace, the parts are typically written within different namespace declarations. Thus, different `extern alias` directives and `using` directives can be present for each part. When interpreting simple names (§12.7.3) within one part, only the `extern alias` directives and `using` directives of the namespace bodies and compilation unit enclosing that part are considered. This may result in the same identifier having different meanings in different parts. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace N
{
    using List = System.Collections.ArrayList;

    partial class A
    {
        List x; // x has type System.Collections.ArrayList
    }
}

namespace N
{
    using List = Widgets.LinkedList;

    partial class A
    {
        List y; // y has type Widgets.LinkedList
    }
}
```

*end example*]

Using aliases can name a closed constructed type, but cannot name an unbound generic type declaration without supplying type arguments. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace N1
{
    class A<T>
    {
        class B { }
    }
}

namespace N2
{
    using W = N1.A; // Error, cannot name unbound generic type

    using X = N1.A.B; // Error, cannot name unbound generic type

    using Y = N1.A<int>; // Ok, can name closed constructed type

    using Z<T> = N1.A<T>; // Error, using alias cannot have type parameters
}
```

*end example*]

### Using namespace directives

A *using-namespace-directive* imports the types contained in a namespace into the immediately enclosing compilation unit or namespace body, enabling the identifier of each type to be used without qualification.

```antlr
using-namespace-directive:
    using namespace-name ;
```

Within member declarations in a compilation unit or namespace body that contains a *using-namespace-directive*, the types contained in the given namespace can be referenced directly. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class A { }
}

namespace N3
{
    using N1.N2;

    class B : A { }
}
```

Above, within member declarations in the `N3` namespace, the type members of `N1.N2` are directly available, and thus class `N3.B` derives from class `N1.N2.A`. *end example*]

A *using-namespace-directive* imports the types contained in the given namespace, but specifically does not import nested namespaces. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class A { }
}

namespace N3
{
    using N1;

    class B : N2.A { } // Error, N2 unknown
}
```

the *using-namespace-directive* imports the types contained in `N1`, but not the namespaces nested in `N1`. Thus, the reference to `N2.A` in the declaration of `B` results in a compile-time error because no members named `N2` are in scope. *end example*]

Unlike a *using-alias-directive*, a *using-namespace-directive* may import types whose identifiers are already defined within the enclosing compilation unit or namespace body. In effect, names imported by a *using-namespace-directive* are hidden by similarly named members in the enclosing compilation unit or namespace body. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace N1.N2
{
    class A { }

    class B { }
}

namespace N3
{
    using N1.N2;

    class A { }
}
```

Here, within member declarations in the `N3` namespace, `A` refers to `N3.A` rather than `N1.N2.A`. *end example*]

Because names may be ambiguous when more than one imported namespace introduces the same type name, a *using-alias-directive* is useful to disambiguate the reference. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
namespace N1
{
    class A { }
}

namespace N2
{
    class A { }
}

namespace N3
{
    using N1;
    using N2;

    class B : A { } // Error, A is ambiguous
}
```

both `N1` and `N2` contain a member `A`, and because `N3` imports both, referencing `A` in `N3` is a compile-time error. In this situation, the conflict can be resolved either through qualification of references to `A`, or by introducing a *using-alias-directive* that picks a particular `A`. For example:

```csharp
namespace N3
{
    using N1;
    using N2;

    using A = N1.A;

    class B : A { } // A means N1.A
}
```

*end example*]

Like a *using-alias-directive*, a *using-namespace-directive* does not contribute any new members to the underlying declaration space of the compilation unit or namespace, but, rather, affects only the compilation unit or namespace body in which it appears.

The *namespace-name* referenced by a *using-namespace-directive* is resolved in the same way as the *namespace-or-type-name* referenced by a *using-alias-directive*. Thus, *using-namespace-directive*s in the same compilation unit or namespace body do not affect each other and can be written in any order.

## Namespace member declarations

A *namespace-member-declaration* is either a *namespace-declaration* (§14.3) or a *type-declaration* (§14.7).

```antlr
namespace-member-declarations:
    namespace-member-declaration
    namespace-member-declarations namespace-member-declaration

namespace-member-declaration:
    namespace-declaration
    type-declaration
```

A compilation unit or a namespace body can contain *namespace-member-declarations*, and such declarations contribute new members to the underlying declaration space of the containing compilation unit or namespace body.

## Type declarations

A *type-declaration* is a *class-declaration* (§15.2), a *struct-declaration* (§16.2), an *interface-declaration* (§18.2), an *enum-declaration* (§19.2), or a *delegate-declaration* (§20.2).

```antlr
type-declaration:
    class-declaration
    struct-declaration
    interface-declaration
    enum-declaration
    delegate-declaration
```

A *type-declaration* can occur as a top-level declaration in a compilation unit or as a member declaration within a namespace, class, or struct.

When a type declaration for a type `T` occurs as a top-level declaration in a compilation unit, the fully qualified name (§8.8.2) of the type declaration is the same as the unqualified name of the declaration (§8.8.2). When a type declaration for a type `T` occurs within a namespace, class, or struct declaration, the fully qualified name (§8.8.3) of the type declarationis `S.N`, where `S` is the fully qualified name of the containing namespace, class, or struct declaration, and `N` is the unqualified name of the declaration.

A type declared within a class or struct is called a nested type (§15.3.9).

The permitted access modifiers and the default access for a type declaration depend on the context in which the declaration takes place (§8.5.2):

- Types declared in compilation units or namespaces can have `public` or `internal` access. The default is `internal` access.
- Types declared in classes can have `public`, `protected internal`, `protected`, `internal`, or `private` access. The default is `private` access.
- Types declared in structs can have `public`, `internal`, or `private` access. The default is `private` access.

## Qualified alias member

### General

The ***namespace alias qualifier*** `::` makes it possible to guarantee that type name lookups are unaffected by the introduction of new types and members. The namespace alias qualifier always appears between two identifiers referred to as the left-hand and right-hand identifiers. Unlike the regular `.` qualifier, the left-hand identifier of the `::` qualifier is looked up only as an `extern` or `using` alias.

A *qualified-alias-member* provides explicit access to the global namespace and to extern or using aliases that are potentially hidden by other entities.

```antlr
qualified-alias-member:
    identifier :: identifier type-argument-listopt
```

A *qualified-alias-member* can be used as a *namespace-or-type-name* (§8.8) or as the left operand in a *member-access* (§12.7.5).

A *qualified-alias-member* consists of two identifiers, referred to as the left-hand and right-hand identifiers, seperated by the `::` token and optionally followed by a *type-argument-list*. When the left-hand identifier is global then the global namespace is searched for the right-hand identifier. For any other left-hand identifier, that identifier is looked up as an `extern` or `using` alias (§14.4 and §14.5.2). A compile-time error occurs if there is no such alias or the alias references a type. If the alias references a namespace then that namespace is searched for the right-hand identifier.

A *qualified-alias-member* has one of two forms:

- `N::I<A1, …, AK>`, where N and I represent identifiers, and `<A1, …, AK>` is a type argument list. (`K` is always at least one.)
- `N::I`, where `N` and `I` represent identifiers. (In this case, `K` is considered to be zero.)

Using this notation, the meaning of a *qualified-alias-member* is determined as follows:

- If `N` is the identifier global, then the global namespace is searched for `I`:
  - If the global namespace contains a namespace named `I` and `K` is zero, then the *qualified-alias-member* refers to that namespace.
  - Otherwise, if the global namespace contains a non-generic type named `I` and `K` is zero, then the *qualified-alias-member* refers to that type.
  - Otherwise, if the global namespace contains a type named `I` that has `K` type parameters, then the *qualified-alias-member* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments.
  - Otherwise, the *qualified-alias-member* is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, starting with the namespace declaration (§14.3) immediately containing the *qualified-alias-member* (if any), continuing with each enclosing namespace declaration (if any), and ending with the compilation unit containing the *qualified-alias-member*, the following steps are evaluated until an entity is located:
  - If the namespace declaration or compilation unit contains a *using-alias-directive* that associates N with a type, then the *qualified-alias-member* is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.
  - Otherwise, if the namespace declaration or compilation unit contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates `N` with a namespace, then:
    - If the namespace associated with `N` contains a namespace named `I` and `K` is zero, then the *qualified-alias-member* refers to that namespace.
    - Otherwise, if the namespace associated with `N` contains a non-generic type named `I` and `K` is zero, then the *qualified-alias-member* refers to that type.
    - Otherwise, if the namespace associated with `N` contains a type named `I` that has `K` type parameters, then the *qualified-alias-member* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments.
    - Otherwise, the *qualified-alias-member* is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, the *qualified-alias-member* is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.

[*Example*: In the code:

```csharp
using S = System.Net.Sockets;

class A
{
    public static int x;
}

class C
{
    public void F (int A, object S)
    {
        // Use global::A.x instead of A.x
        global::A.x += A;

        // Use S::Socket instead of S.Socket
        S::Socket s = S as S::Socket;
    }
}
```

the class `A` is referenced with `global::A` and the type `System.Net.Sockets.Socket` is referenced with `S::Socket`. Using `A.x` and `S.Socket` instead would have caused compile-time errors because `A` and `S` would have resolved to the parameters. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> The identifier global has special meaning only when used as the left-hand identifier of a *qualified-alias-name*. It is not a keyword and it is not itself an alias; it is a contextual keyword (§7.4.4). In the code:
> 
> ```csharp
> class A { }
> 
> class C
> {
>     global.A x; // Error: global is not defined
>     global::A y; // Valid: References A in the global namespace
> }
> ```
> 
> using `global.A` causes a compile-time error since there is no entity named global in scope. If some entity named global were in scope, then `global` in `global.A` would have resolved to that entity.
> 
> Using `global` as the left-hand identifier of a *qualified-alias-member* always causes a lookup in the `global` namespace, even if there is a using alias named `global`. In the code:
> 
> ```csharp
> using global = MyGlobalTypes;
> 
> class A { }
> 
> class C
> {
>     global.A x; // Valid: References MyGlobalTypes.A
>     global::A y; // Valid: References A in the global namespace
> }
> ```
> 
> `global.A` resolves to `MyGlobalTypes.A` and `global::A` resolves to class `A` in the `global` namespace. 

### Uniqueness of aliases

Each compilation unit and namespace body has a separate declaration space for `extern` aliases and `using` aliases. Thus, while the name of an `extern` alias or `using` alias shall be unique within the set of `extern` aliases and `using` aliases declared in the immediately containing compilation unit or namespace body, an alias is permitted to have the same name as a type or namespace as long as it is used only with the `::` qualifier.

[*Example*: In the following:

```csharp
namespace N
{
    public class A { }

    public class B { }
}

namespace N
{
    using A = System.IO;

    class X
    {
        A.Stream s1; // Error, A is ambiguous

        A::Stream s2; // Ok
    }
}
```

the name `A` has two possible meanings in the second namespace body because both the class `A` and the using alias `A` are in scope. For this reason, use of `A` in the qualified name `A.Stream` is ambiguous and causes a compile-time error to occur. However, use of `A` with the `::` qualifier is not an error because `A` is looked up only as a namespace alias. *end example*]

# Classes

## General

A class is a data structure that may contain data members (constants and fields), function members (methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors), and nested types. Class types support inheritance, a mechanism whereby a ***derived class*** can extend and specialize a ***base class***.

## Class declarations

### General

A *class-declaration* is a *type-declaration* (§14.7) that declares a new class.

```antlr
class-declaration:
    attributesopt class-modifiersopt partialopt class identifier type-parameter-listopt
    class-baseopt type-parameter-constraints-clausesopt class-body ;opt
```

A *class-declaration* consists of an optional set of *attributes* (§22), followed by an optional set of *class-modifiers* (§15.2.2), followed by an optional partial modifier (§15.2.7), followed by the keyword class and an *identifier* that names the class, followed by an optional *type-parameter-list* (§15.2.3), followed by an optional *class-base* specification (§15.2.4), followed by an optional set of *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* (§15.2.5), followed by a *class-body* (§15.2.6), optionally followed by a semicolon.

A class declaration shall not supply a *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* unless it also supplies a *type-parameter-list*.

A class declaration that supplies a *type-parameter-list* is a generic class declaration. Additionally, any class nested inside a generic class declaration or a generic struct declaration is itself a generic class declaration, since type arguments for the containing type shall be supplied to create a constructed type.

### Class modifiers

#### General

A *class-declaration* may optionally include a sequence of class modifiers:

```antlr
class-modifiers:
    class-modifier
    class-modifiers class-modifier

class-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    abstract
    sealed
    static
```

It is a compile-time error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in a class declaration.

The `new` modifier is permitted on nested classes. It specifies that the class hides an inherited member by the same name, as described in §15.3.5. It is a compile-time error for the `new` modifier to appear on a class declaration that is not a nested class declaration.

The public, protected, internal, and private modifiers control the accessibility of the class. Depending on the context in which the class declaration occurs, some of these modifiers might not be permitted (§8.5.2).

When a partial type declaration (§15.2.7) includes an accessibility specification (via the `public`, `protected`, `internal`, and `private` modifiers), that specification shall agree with all other parts that include an accessibility specification. If no part of a partial type includes an accessibility specification, the type is given the appropriate default accessibility (§8.5.2).

The `abstract`, `sealed`, and `static` modifiers are discussed in the following subclauses.

#### Abstract classes

The `abstract` modifier is used to indicate that a class is incomplete and that it is intended to be used only as a base class. An ***abstract class*** differs from a ***non-abstract class*** in the following ways:

- An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly, and it is a compile-time error to use the `new` operator on an abstract class. While it is possible to have variables and values whose compile-time types are abstract, such variables and values will necessarily either be null or contain references to instances of non-abstract classes derived from the abstract types.
- An abstract class is permitted (but not required) to contain abstract members.
- An abstract class cannot be `sealed`.

When a non-abstract class is derived from an abstract class, the non-abstract class shall include actual implementations of all inherited abstract members, thereby overriding those abstract members. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
abstract class A
{
    public abstract void F ();
}

abstract class B : A
{
    public void G () { }
}

class C : B
{
    public override void F ()
    {
        // actual implementation of F
    }
}
```

the abstract class `A` introduces an abstract method `F`. Class `B` introduces an additional method `G`, but since it doesn’t provide an implementation of `F`, `B` shall also be declared abstract. Class `C` overrides `F` and provides an actual implementation. Since there are no abstract members in `C`, `C` is permitted (but not required) to be non-abstract. *end example*]

If one or more parts of a partial type declaration (§15.2.7) of a class include the `abstract` modifier, the class is abstract. Otherwise, the class is non-abstract.

#### Sealed classes

The `sealed` modifier is used to prevent derivation from a class. A compile-time error occurs if a sealed class is specified as the base class of another class.

A sealed class cannot also be an abstract class.

> [!NOTE]
> The `sealed` modifier is primarily used to prevent unintended derivation, but it also enables certain run-time optimizations. In particular, because a sealed class is known to never have any derived classes, it is possible to transform virtual function member invocations on sealed class instances into non-virtual invocations.

If one or more parts of a partial type declaration (§15.2.7) of a class include the `sealed` modifier, the class is sealed. Otherwise, the class is unsealed.

#### Static classes

##### General

The `static` modifier is used to mark the class being declared as a ***static class***. A static class shall not be instantiated, shall not be used as a type and shall contain only static members. Only a static class can contain declarations of extension methods (§15.6.10).

A static class declaration is subject to the following restrictions:

- A static class shall not include a `sealed` or `abstract` modifier. (However, since a static class cannot be instantiated or derived from, it behaves as if it was both `sealed` and `abstract`.)
- A static class shall not include a *class-base* specification (§15.2.4) and cannot explicitly specify a base class or a list of implemented interfaces. A static class implicitly inherits from type `object`.
- A static class shall only contain static members (§15.3.8). 
  > [!NOTE]
  > All constants and nested types are classified as static members.
- A static class shall not have members with `protected` or `protected internal` declared accessibility.

It is a compile-time error to violate any of these restrictions.

A static class has no instance constructors. It is not possible to declare an instance constructor in a static class, and no default instance constructor (§15.11.5) is provided for a static class.

The members of a static class are not automatically static, and the member declarations shall explicitly include a static modifier (except for constants and nested types). When a class is nested within a static outer class, the nested class is not a static class unless it explicitly includes a static modifier.

If one or more parts of a partial type declaration (§15.2.7) of a class include the `static` modifier, the class is static. Otherwise, the class is not static.

##### Referencing static class types

A *namespace-or-type-name* (§8.8) is permitted to reference a static class if

- The *namespace-or-type-name* is the `T` in a *namespace-or-type-name* of the form `T.I`, or
- The *namespace-or-type-name* is the `T` in a *typeof-expression* (§12.7.12) of the form `typeof(T)`.

A *primary-expression* (§12.7) is permitted to reference a static class if

- The *primary-expression* is the `E` in a *member-access* (§12.7.5) of the form `E.I`.

In any other context, it is a compile-time error to reference a static class. 

> [!NOTE]
> For example, it is an error for a static class to be used as a base class, a constituent type (§15.3.7) of a member, a generic type argument, or a type parameter constraint. Likewise, a static class cannot be used in an array type, a pointer type, a `new` expression, a `cast` expression, an `is` expression, an `as` expression, a `sizeof` expression, or a default value expression.

### Type parameters

A type parameter is a simple identifier that denotes a placeholder for a type argument supplied to create a constructed type. By constrast, a type argument (§9.4.2) is the type that is substituted for the type parameter when a constructed type is created.

```antlr
type-parameter-list:
    < type-parameters >

type-parameters:
    attributesopt type-parameter
    type-parameters , attributesopt type-parameter
```

*type-parameter* is defined in §9.5.

Each `type` parameter in a class declaration defines a name in the declaration space (§8.3) of that class. Thus, it cannot have the same name as another `type` parameter of that class or a member declared in that class. A `type` parameter cannot have the same name as the type itself.

Two partial generic type declarations (in the same program) contribute to the same unbound generic type if they have the same fully qualified name (which includes a *generic-dimension-specifier* (§12.7.12) for the number of type parameters) (§8.8.3). Two such partial type declarations shall specify the same name for each type parameter, in order.

### Class base specification

#### General

A class declaration may include a *class-base* specification, which defines the direct base class of the class and the interfaces (§18) directly implemented by the class.

```antlr
class-base:
    : class-type
    : interface-type-list
    : class-type , interface-type-list

interface-type-list:
    interface-type
    interface-type-list , interface-type
```

#### Base classes

When a *class-type* is included in the *class-base*, it specifies the direct base class of the class being declared. If a non-partial class declaration has no *class-base*, or if the *class-base* lists only interface types, the direct base class is assumed to be object. When a partial class declaration includes a base class specification, that base class specification shall reference the same type as all other parts of that partial type that include a base class specification. If no part of a partial class includes a base class specification, the base class is `object`. A class inherits members from its direct base class, as described in §15.3.4.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A {}

class B: A {}
```

class `A` is said to be the direct base class of `B`, and `B` is said to be derived from `A`. Since `A` does not explicitly specify a direct base class, its direct base class is implicitly `object`. *end example*]

For a constructed class type, including a nested type declared within a generic type declaration (§16.3.9.7), if a base class is specified in the generic class declaration, the base class of the constructed type is obtained by substituting, for each *type-parameter* in the base class declaration, the corresponding *type-argument* of the constructed type. [*Example*: Given the generic class declarations

```csharp
class B<U,V> {…}

class G<T>: B<string,T[]> {…}
```

the base class of the constructed type `G<int>` would be `B<string,int[]>`. *end example*]

The base class specified in a class declaration can be a constructed class type (§9.4). A base class cannot be a type parameter on its own (§9.5), though it can involve the type parameters that are in scope. [*Example*:

```csharp
class Base<T> { }

class Extend : Base<int> // Valid, non-constructed class with
    // constructed base class

    class Extend<V> : V { } // Error, type parameter used as base class

class Extend<V> : Base<V> { } // Valid, type parameter used as type
// argument for base class
```

*end example*]

The direct base class of a class type shall be at least as accessible as the class type itself (§8.5.5). For example, it is a compile-time error for a public class to derive from a `private` or `internal` class.

The direct base class of a class type shall not be any of the following types: `System.Array`, `System.Delegate`, `System.Enum`, or `System.ValueType`. Furthermore, a generic class declaration shall not use `System.Attribute` as a direct or indirect base class (§22.2.1).

In determining the meaning of the direct base class specification `A` of a class `B`, the direct base class of `B` is temporarily assumed to be `object`, which ensures that the meaning of a base class specification cannot recursively depend on itself. [*Example*: The following

```csharp
class X<T>
{
    public class Y { }
}

class Z : X<Z.Y> { }
```

Is in error since in the base class specification `X<Z.Y>` the direct base class of `Z` is considered to be `object`, and hence (by the rules of §8.8) `Z` is not considered to have a member `Y`. *end example*]

The base classes of a class are the direct base class and its base classes. In other words, the set of base classes is the transitive closure of the direct base class relationship. [*Example*: In the following:

```csharp
class A {…}

class B<T> : A {…}

class C<T> : B<IComparable<T>> {…}

class D<T> : C<T[]> {…}
```

the base classes of `D<int>` are `C<int[]>`, `B<IComparable<int[]>>`, `A`, and `object`.

*end example*]

Except for class `object`, every class has exactly one direct base class. The `object` class has no direct base class and is the ultimate base class of all other classes.

It is a compile-time error for a class to depend on itself. For the purpose of this rule, a class ***directly depends on*** its direct base class (if any) and *directly depends on* the nearest enclosing class within which it is nested (if any). Given this definition, the complete set of classes upon which a class depends is the transitive closure of the *directly depends on* relationship.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
class A: A {}
```

Is erroneous because the class depends on itself. Likewise, the example

```csharp
class A: B {}

class B: C {}

class C: A {}
```

is in error because the classes circularly depend on themselves. Finally, the example

```csharp
class A : B.C { }

class B : A
{
    public class C { }
}
```

results in a compile-time error because A depends on `B.C` (its direct base class), which depends on `B` (its immediately enclosing class), which circularly depends on `A`. *end example*]

A class does not depend on the classes that are nested within it. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    class B : A { }
}
```

`B` depends on `A` (because `A` is both its direct base class and its immediately enclosing class), but `A` does not depend on `B` (since `B` is neither a base class nor an enclosing class of `A`). Thus, the example is valid. *end example*]

It is not possible to derive from a sealed class. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
sealed class A {}

class B: A {} // Error, cannot derive from a sealed class
```

class `B` is in error because it attempts to derive from the sealed class `A`. *end example*]

#### Interface implementations

A *class-base* specification may include a list of interface types, in which case the class is said to implement the given interface types. For a constructed class type, including a nested type declared within a generic type declaration (§15.3.9.7), each implemented interface type is obtained by substituting, for each *type-parameter* in the given interface, the corresponding *type-argument* of the constructed type.

The set of interfaces for a type declared in multiple parts (§15.2.7) is the union of the interfaces specified on each part. A particular interface can only be named once on each part, but multiple parts can name the same base interface(s). There shall only be one implementation of each member of any given interface. [*Example*: In the following:

```csharp
partial class C: IA, IB {…}

partial class C: IC {…}

partial class C: IA, IB {…}
```

the set of base interfaces for class `C` is `IA`, `IB`, and `IC`. *end example*]

Typically, each part provides an implementation of the interface(s) declared on that part; however, this is not a requirement. A part can provide the implementation for an interface declared on a different part. [*Example*:

```csharp
partial class X
{
    int IComparable.CompareTo (object o) {…}
}

partial class X : IComparable
{
    …
}
```

*end example*]

The base interfaces specified in a class declaration can be constructed interface types (§9.4, §18.2). A base interface cannot be a type parameter on its own, though it can involve the type parameters that are in scope. [*Example*: The following code illustrates how a class can implement and extend constructed types:

```csharp
class C<U, V> { }

interface I1<V> { }

class D : C<string, int>, I1<string> { }

class E<T> : C<int, T>, I1<T> { }
```

*end example*]

Interface implementations are discussed further in §18.6.

### Type parameter constraints

Generic type and method declarations can optionally specify type parameter constraints by including *type-parameter-constraints-clause*s.

```antlr
type-parameter-constraints-clauses:
    type-parameter-constraints-clause
    type-parameter-constraints-clauses type-parameter-constraints-clause

type-parameter-constraints-clause:
    where type-parameter : type-parameter-constraints

type-parameter-constraints:
    primary-constraint
    secondary-constraints
    constructor-constraint
    primary-constraint , secondary-constraints
    primary-constraint , constructor-constraint
    secondary-constraints , constructor-constraint
    primary-constraint , secondary-constraints , constructor-constraint

primary-constraint:
    class-type
    class
    struct

secondary-constraints:
    interface-type
    type-parameter
    secondary-constraints , interface-type
    secondary-constraints , type-parameter

constructor-constraint:
    new ( )
```

Each *type-parameter-constraints-clause* consists of the token where, followed by the name of a type parameter, followed by a colon and the list of constraints for that type parameter. There can be at most one where clause for each type parameter, and the where clauses can be listed in any order. Like the get and set tokens in a property accessor, the where token is not a keyword.

The list of constraints given in a where clause can include any of the following components, in this order: a single primary constraint, one or more secondary constraints, and the constructor constraint, new().

A primary constraint can be a class type or the ***reference type constraint*** class or the ***value type constraint*** struct. A secondary constraint can be a *type-parameter* or *interface-type*.

The reference type constraint specifies that a type argument used for the type parameter shall be a reference type. All class types, interface types, delegate types, array types, and type parameters known to be a reference type (as defined below) satisfy this constraint.

The value type constraint specifies that a type argument used for the type parameter shall be a non-nullable value type. All non-nullable struct types, enum types, and type parameters having the value type constraint satisfy this constraint. Note that although classified as a value type, a nullable value type (§9.3.11) does not satisfy the value type constraint. A type parameter having the value type constraint shall not also have the *constructor-constraint*, although it may be used as a type argument for another type parameter with a *constructor-constraint*. 

> [!NOTE]
> The `System.Nullable<T>` type specifies the non-nullable value type constraint for `T`. Thus, recursively constructed types of the forms `T??` and `Nullable<Nullable<T>>` are prohibited.

Pointer types are never allowed to be type arguments and are not considered to satisfy either the reference type or value type constraints.

If a constraint is a class type, an interface type, or a type parameter, that type specifies a minimal “base type” that every type argument used for that type parameter shall support. Whenever a constructed type or generic method is used, the type argument is checked against the constraints on the type parameter at compile-time. The type argument supplied shall satisfy the conditions described in §9.4.5.

A *class-type* constraint shall satisfy the following rules:

- The type shall be a `class` type.
- The type shall not be `sealed`.
- The type shall not be one of the following types: `System.Array`, `System.Delegate`, `System.Enum`, or `System.ValueType`.
- The type shall not be `object`.
- At most one constraint for a given type parameter may be a class type.

A type specified as an *interface-type* constraint shall satisfy the following rules:

- The type shall be an interface type.
- A type shall not be specified more than once in a given where clause.

In either case, the constraint may involve any of the type parameters of the associated type or method declaration as part of a constructed type, and may involve the type being declared.

Any class or interface type specified as a type parameter constraint shall be at least as accessible (§8.5.5) as the generic type or method being declared.

A type specified as a *type-parameter* constraint shall satisfy the following rules:

- The type shall be a type parameter.
- A type shall not be specified more than once in a given where clause.

In addition there shall be no cycles in the dependency graph of type parameters, where dependency is a transitive relation defined by:

- If a type parameter `T` is used as a constraint for type parameter `S` then `S` ***depends on*** T.
- If a type parameter `S` depends on a type parameter `T` and `T` depends on a type parameter `U` then `S` ***depends on*** `U`.

Given this relation, it is a compile-time error for a type parameter to depend on itself (directly or indirectly).

Any constraints shall be consistent among dependent type parameters. If type parameter `S` depends on type parameter `T` then:

- `T` shall not have the value type constraint. Otherwise, `T` is effectively sealed so S would be forced to be the same type as `T`, eliminating the need for two type parameters.
- If `S` has the value type constraint then `T` shall not have a *class-type* constraint.
- If `S` has a *class-type* constraint `A` and `T` has a *class-type* constraint `B` then there shall be an identity conversion or implicit reference conversion from `A` to `B` or an implicit reference conversion from `B` to `A`.
- If `S` also depends on type parameter `U` and `U` has a *class-type* constraint `A` and `T` has a *class-type* constraint `B` then there shall be an identity conversion or implicit reference conversion from `A` to `B` or an implicit reference conversion from `B` to `A`.

It is valid for `S` to have the value type constraint and `T` to have the reference type constraint. Effectively this limits `T` to the types `System.Object`, `System.ValueType`, `System.Enum`, and any interface type.

If the where clause for a type parameter includes a constructor constraint (which has the form new()), it is possible to use the `new` operator to create instances of the type (§12.7.11.2). Any type argument used for a type parameter with a constructor constraint shall be a value type, a non-abstract class having a public parameterless constructor, or a type parameter having the value type constraint or constructor constraint.

[*Example*: The following are examples of constraints:

```csharp
interface IPrintable
{
    void Print ();
}

interface IComparable<T>
{
    int CompareTo (T value);
}

interface IKeyProvider<T>
{

    T GetKey ();
}

class Printer<T> where T : IPrintable {…}

class SortedList<T> where T : IComparable<T> {…}

class Dictionary<K, V>
    where K : IComparable<K>
    where V : IPrintable, IKeyProvider<K>, new ()
{
    …
}
```

The following example is in error because it causes a circularity in the dependency graph of the type parameters:

```csharp
class Circular<S,T>
    where S: T
    where T: S // Error, circularity in dependency graph
{
…
}
```

The following examples illustrate additional invalid situations:

```csharp
class Sealed<S, T>
    where S : T
    where T : struct // Error, T is sealed
{
    …
}

class A {…}

class B {…}

class Incompat<S, T>
    where S : A, T
    where T : B // Error, incompatible class-type constraints
{
    …
}

class StructWithClass<S, T, U>
    where S : struct, T
    where T : U
    where U : A // Error, A incompatible with struct
{
    …
}
```

*end example*]

The ***dynamic erasure*** of a type `C` is type `Co` constructed as follows:

- If `C` is a *nested type* `Outer.Inner` then `Co` is a nested type `Outero.Innero`.
- If `C` is a *constructed type* `G<A^1^, …, A^n^>` with type arguments `A^1^, …, A^n^` then `Co` is the constructed type `G<A^1^o, …, A^n^o>`.`
- If `C` is an *array type* E[]` then `Co` is the array type `Eo[]`.
- If `C` is a *pointer type* `E*` then `Co` is the pointer type `Eo*`.
- If `C` is `dynamic` then `Co` is `object`.
- Otherwise, `Co` is `C`.

The ***effective base class*** of a type parameter `T` is defined as follows:

Let `R` be a set of types such that:

- For each constraint of `T` that is a *type-parameter*, `R` contains its effective base class.
- For each constraint of `T` that is a *struct-type*, `R` contains `System.ValueType`.
- For each constraint of `T` that is an *enumeration type*, `R` contains `System.Enum`.
- For each constraint of `T` that is a *delegate type*, `R` contains its dynamic erasure.
- For each constraint of `T` that is an *array type*, `R` contains `System.Array`.
- For each constraint of `T` that is a *class-type*, `R` contains its dynamic erasure.

Then

- If `T` has the value type constraint, its *effective base class* is `System.ValueType`.
- Otherwise, if `R` is empty then the *effective base class* is `object`.
- Otherwise, the *effective base class* of `T` is the most-encompassed type (§11.5.3) of set `R`. If the set has no encompassed type, the *effective base class* of `T` is `object`. The consistency rules ensure that the most-encompassed type exists.

If the type parameter is a method type parameter whose constraints are inherited from the base method the *effective base class* is calculated after type substitution.

These rules ensure that the effective base class is always a *class-type*.

The ***effective interface set*** of a type parameter `T` is defined as follows:

- If `T` has no *secondary-constraints*, its effective interface set is empty.
- If `T` has *interface-type* constraints but no *type-parameter* constraints, its effective interface set is the set of dynamic erasures of its *interface-type* constraints.
- If `T` has no *interface-type* constraints but has *type-parameter* constraints, its effective interface set is the union of the effective interface sets of its *type-parameter* constraints.
- If `T` has both *interface-type* constraints and *type-parameter* constraints, its effective interface set is the union of the set of dynamic erasures of its *interface-type* constraints and the effective interface sets of its *type-parameter* constraints.

A type parameter is ***known to be a reference type*** if it has the reference type constraint or its effective base class is not `object` or `System.ValueType`.

Values of a constrained type parameter type can be used to access the instance members implied by the constraints. [*Example*: In the following:

```csharp
interface IPrintable
{
    void Print ();
}

class Printer<T> where T : IPrintable
{
    void PrintOne (T x)
    {
        x.Print ();
    }
}
```

the methods of `IPrintable` can be invoked directly on `x` because `T` is constrained to always implement `IPrintable`. *end example*]

When a partial generic type declaration includes constraints, the constraints shall agree with all other parts that include constraints. Specifically, each part that includes constraints shall have constraints for the same set of type parameters, and for each type parameter, the sets of primary, secondary, and constructor constraints shall be equivalent. Two sets of constraints are equivalent if they contain the same members. If no part of a partial generic type specifies type parameter constraints, the type parameters are considered unconstrained. [*Example*:

```csharp
partial class Map<K, V>
    where K : IComparable<K>
    where V : IKeyProvider<K>, new ()
{
    …
}

partial class Map<K, V>
    where V : IKeyProvider<K>, new ()
    where K : IComparable<K>
{
    …
}

partial class Map<K, V>
{
    …
}
```

is correct because those parts that include constraints (the first two) effectively specify the same set of primary, secondary, and constructor constraints for the same set of type parameters, respectively. *end example*]

### Class body

The *class-body* of a class defines the members of that class.

```antlr
class-body:
    { class-member-declarationsopt }
```

### Partial declarations

The modifier `partial` is used when defining a class, struct, or interface type in multiple parts. The `partial` modifier is a contextual keyword (§7.4.4) and only has special meaning immediately before one of the keywords `class`, `struct`, or `interface`.

Each part of a ***partial type*** declaration shall include a `partial` modifier and shall be declared in the same namespace or containing type as the other parts. The `partial` modifier indicates that additional parts of the type declaration might exist elsewhere, but the existence of such additional parts is not a requirement; it is valid for the only declaration of a type to include the `partial` modifier.

All parts of a partial type shall be compiled together such that the parts can be merged at compile-time. Partial types specifically do not allow already compiled types to be extended.

Nested types can be declared in multiple parts by using the `partial` modifier. Typically, the containing type is declared using `partial` as well, and each part of the nested type is declared in a different part of the containing type.

[*Example*: The following partial class is implemented in two parts, which reside in different source files. The first part is machine generated by a database-mapping tool while the second part is manually authored:

```csharp
public partial class Customer
{
    private int id;
    private string name;
    private string address;
    private List<Order> orders;

    public Customer ()
    {
        …
    }
}

public partial class Customer
{
    public void SubmitOrder (Order orderSubmitted)
    {
        orders.Add (orderSubmitted);
    }

    public bool HasOutstandingOrders ()
    {
        return orders.Count > 0;
    }
}
```

When the two parts above are compiled together, the resulting code behaves as if the class had been written as a single unit, as follows:

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    private int id;
    private string name;
    private string address;
    private List<Order> orders;

    public Customer ()
    {
        …
    }

    public void SubmitOrder (Order orderSubmitted)
    {
        orders.Add (orderSubmitted);
    }

    public bool HasOutstandingOrders ()
    {
        return orders.Count > 0;
    }
}
```

*end example*]

The handling of attributes specified on the type or type parameters of different parts of a partial declaration is discussed in §22.3.

## Class members

### General

The members of a class consist of the members introduced by its *class-member-declaration*s and the members inherited from the direct base class.

```antlr
class-member-declarations:
    class-member-declaration
    class-member-declarations class-member-declaration

class-member-declaration:
    constant-declaration
    field-declaration
    method-declaration
    property-declaration
    event-declaration
    indexer-declaration
    operator-declaration
    constructor-declaration
    finalizer-declaration
    static-constructor-declaration
    type-declaration
```

The members of a class are divided into the following categories:

- Constants, which represent constant values associated with the class (§15.4).
- Fields, which are the variables of the class (§15.5).
- Methods, which implement the computations and actions that can be performed by the class (§15.6).
- Properties, which define named characteristics and the actions associated with reading and writing those characteristics (§15.7).
- Events, which define notifications that can be generated by the class (§15.8).
- Indexers, which permit instances of the class to be indexed in the same way (syntactically) as arrays (§15.9).
- Operators, which define the expression operators that can be applied to instances of the class (§15.10).
- Instance constructors, which implement the actions required to initialize instances of the class (§15.11)
- Finalizers, which implement the actions to be performed before instances of the class are permanently discarded (§15.13).
- Static constructors, which implement the actions required to initialize the class itself (§15.12).
- Types, which represent the types that are local to the class (§14.7).

Members that can contain executable code are collectively known as the *function members* of the class. The function members of a class are the methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors of that class.

A *class-declaration* creates a new declaration space (§8.3), and the *type-parameter*sand the *class-member-declarations* immediately contained by the *class-declaration* introduce new members into this declaration space. The following rules apply to *class-member-declaration*s:

- Instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors shall have the same name as the immediately enclosing class. All other members shall have names that differ from the name of the immediately enclosing class.
- The name of a type parameter in the *type-parameter-list* of a class declaration shall differ from the names of all other type parameters in the same *type-parameter-list* and shall differ from the name of the class and the names of all members of the class.
- The name of a type shall differ from the names of all non-type members declared in the same class. If two or more type declarations share the same fully qualified name, the declarations shall have the partial modifier (§15.2.7) and these declarations combine to define a single type. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > Since the fully qualified name of a type declaration encodes the number of type parameters, two distinct types may share the same name as long as they have different number of type parameters.
- The name of a constant, field, property, or event shall differ from the names of all other members declared inthe same class.
- The name of a method shall differ from the names of all other non-methods declared in the same class. In addition, the signature (§8.6) of a method shall differ from the signatures of all other methods declared in the same class, and two methods declared in the same class shall not have signatures that differ solely by ref and out.
- The signature of an instance constructor shall differ from the signatures of all other instance constructors declared in the same class, and two constructors declared in the same class shall not have signatures that differ solely by ref and out.
- The signature of an indexer shall differ from the signatures of all other indexers declared in the same class.
- The signature of an operator shall differ from the signatures of all other operators declared in the same class.

The inherited members of a class (§15.3.4) are not part of the declaration space of a class. 

> [!NOTE]
> Thus, a derived class is allowed to declare a member with the same name or signature as an inherited member (which in effect hides the inherited member).

The set of members of a type declared in multiple parts (§15.2.7) is the union of the members declared in each part. The bodies of all parts of the type declaration share the same declaration space (§8.3), and the scope of each member (§8.7) extends to the bodies of all the parts. The accessibility domain of any member always includes all the parts of the enclosing type; a private member declared in one part is freely accessible from another part. It is a compile-time error to declare the same member in more than one part of the type, unless that member is a type having the `partial` modifier. [*Example*:

```csharp
partial class A
{
    int x; // Error, cannot declare x more than once

    partial class Inner // Ok, Inner is a partial type
    {
        int y;
    }
}

partial class A
{
    int x; // Error, cannot declare x more than once

    partial class Inner // Ok, Inner is a partial type
    {
        int z;
    }
}
```

*end example*]

Field initialization order can be significant within C# code, and some guarantees are provided, as defined in §15.5.6.1. Otherwise, the ordering of members within a type is rarely significant, but may be significant when interfacing with other languages and environments. In these cases, the ordering of members within a type declared in multiple parts is undefined.

### The instance type 

Each class declaration has an associated ***instance type***. For a generic class declaration, the instance type is formed by creating a constructed type (§9.4) from the type declaration, with each of the supplied type arguments being the corresponding type parameter. Since the instance type uses the type parameters, it can only be used where the type parameters are in scope; that is, inside the class declaration. The instance type is the type of this for code written inside the class declaration. For non-generic classes, the instance type is simply the declared class. [*Example*: The following shows several class declarations along with their instance types:

```csharp
class A<T> // instance type: A<T>
    {
        class B { } // instance type: A<T>.B

        class C<U> { } // instance type: A<T>.C<U>
    }

class D { } // instance type: D
```

*end example*]

### Members of constructed types

The non-inherited members of a constructed type are obtained by substituting, for each *type-parameter* in the member declaration, the corresponding *type-argument* of the constructed type. The substitution process is based on the semantic meaning of type declarations, and is not simply textual substitution.

[*Example*: Given the generic class declaration

```csharp
class Gen<T, U>
{
    public T[, ] a;

    public void G (int i, T t, Gen<U, T> gt) {…}

    public U Prop { get {…} set {…} }

    public int H (double d) {…}
}
```

the constructed type `Gen<int[],IComparable<string>>` has the following members:

```csharp
public int[, ][] a;

public void G (int i, int[] t, Gen<IComparable<string>, int[]> gt) {…}

public IComparable<string> Prop { get {…} set {…} }

public int H (double d) {…}
```

The type of the member a in the generic class declaration Gen is “two-dimensional array of `T`”, so the type of the member `a` in the constructed type above is “two-dimensional array of single-dimensional array of `int”`, or `int[,][]`. *end example*]

Within instance function members, the type of this is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the containing declaration.

All members of a generic class can use type parameters from any enclosing class, either directly or as part of a constructed type. When a particular closed constructed type (§9.4.3) is used at run-time, each use of a type parameter is replaced with the type argument supplied to the constructed type. [*Example*:

```csharp
class C<V>
{
    public V f1;
    public C<V> f2 = null;

    public C (V x)
    {
        this.f1 = x;
        this.f2 = this;
    }
}

class Application
{
    static void Main()
    {
        C<int> x1 = new C<int> (1);
        Console.WriteLine (x1.f1); // Prints 1

        C<double> x2 = new C<double> (3.1415);
        Console.WriteLine (x2.f1); // Prints 3.1415
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Inheritance

A class ***inherits*** the members of its direct base class. Inheritance means that a class implicitly contains all members of its direct base class, except for the instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors of the base class. Some important aspects of inheritance are:

- Inheritance is transitive. If `C` is derived from `B`, and `B` is derived from `A`, then `C` inherits the members declared in `B` as well as the members declared in `A`.
- A derived class *extends* its direct base class. A derived class can add new members to those it inherits, but it cannot remove the definition of an inherited member.
- Instance constructors, finalizers, and static constructors are not inherited, but all other members are, regardless of their declared accessibility (§8.5). However, depending on their declared accessibility, inherited members might not be accessible in a derived class.
- A derived class can ***hide*** (§8.7.2.3) inherited members by declaring new members with the same name or signature. However, hiding an inherited member does not remove that member—it merely makes that member inaccessible directly through the derived class.
- An instance of a class contains a set of all instance fields declared in the class and its base classes, and an implicit conversion (§11.2.7) exists from a derived class type to any of its base class types. Thus, a reference to an instance of some derived class can be treated as a reference to an instance of any of its base classes.
- A class can declare virtual methods, properties, indexers, and events, and derived classes can override the implementation of these function members. This enables classes to exhibit polymorphic behavior wherein the actions performed by a function member invocation vary depending on the run-time type of the instance through which that function member is invoked.

The inherited members of a constructed class type are the members of the immediate base class type (§15.2.4.2), which is found by substituting the type arguments of the constructed type for each occurrence of the corresponding type parameters in the *base-class-specification*. These members, in turn, are transformed by substituting, for each *type-parameter* in the member declaration, the corresponding *type-argument* of the *base-class-specification*. [*Example*:

```csharp
class B<U>
{
    public U F (long index) {…}
}

class D<T> : B<T[]>
{
    public T G (string s) {…}
}
```

In the code above, the constructed type `D<int>` has a non-inherited member public `int G(string s)` obtained by substituting the type argument int for the type parameter `T`. `D<int>` also has an inherited member from the class declaration `B`. This inherited member is determined by first determining the base class type `B<int[]>` of `D<int>` by substituting `int` for `T` in the base class specification `B<T[]>`. Then, as a type argument to `B`, `int[]` is substituted for `U` in `public U F(long index)`, yielding the inherited member `public int[] F(long index)`. *end example*]

### The new modifier

A *class-member-declaration* is permitted to declare a member with the same name or signature as an inherited member. When this occurs, the derived class member is said to ***hide*** the base class member. See §8.7.2.3 for a precise specification of when a member hides an inherited member.

An inherited member `M` is considered to be ***available*** if `M` is accessible and there is no other inherited accessible member `N` that already hides `M`. Implicitly hiding an inherited member is not considered an error, but it does cause the compiler to issue a warning unless the declaration of the derived class member includes a `new` modifier to explicitly indicate that the derived member is intended to hide the base member. If one or more parts of a partial declaration (§15.2.7) of a nested type include the `new` modifier, no warning is issued if the nested type hides an available inherited member.

If a `new` modifier is included in a declaration that doesn’t hide an available inherited member, a warning to that effect is issued.

### Access modifiers

A *class-member-declaration* can have any one of the five possible kinds of declared accessibility (§8.5.2): `public`, `protected internal`, `protected`, `internal`, or `private`. Except for the `protected internal` combination, it is a compile-time error to specify more than one access modifier. When a *class-member-declaration* does not include any access modifiers, `private` is assumed.

### Constituent types

Types that are used in the declaration of a member are called the ***constituent types*** of that member. Possible constituent types are the type of a constant, field, property, event, or indexer, the return type of a method or operator, and the parameter types of a method, indexer, operator, or instance constructor. The constituent types of a member shall be at least as accessible as that member itself (§8.5.5).

### Static and instance members

Members of a class are either ***static members*** or ***instance members***. 

> [!NOTE]
> Generally speaking, it is useful to think of static members as belonging to classes and instance members as belonging to objects (instances of classes).

When a field, method, property, event, operator, or constructor declaration includes a static modifier, it declares a static member. In addition, a constant or type declaration implicitly declares a static member. Static members have the following characteristics:

- When a static member `M` is referenced in a *member-access* (§12.7.5) of the form `E.M`, `E` shall denote a type that has a member `M`. It is a compile-time error for `E` to denote an instance.
- A static field in a non-generic class identifies exactly one storage location. No matter how many instances of a non-generic class are created, there is only ever one copy of a static field. Each distinct closed constructed type (§9.4.3) has its own set of static fields, regardless of the number of instances of the closed constructed type.
- A static function member (method, property, event, operator, or constructor) does not operate on a specific instance, and it is a compile-time error to refer to this in such a function member.

When a field, method, property, event, indexer, constructor, or finalizer declaration does not include a static modifier, it declares an instance member. (An instance member is sometimes called a non-static member.) Instance members have the following characteristics:

- When an instance member `M` is referenced in a *member-access* (§12.7.5) of the form `E.M`, `E` shall denote an instance of a type that has a member `M`. It is a binding-time error for `E` to denote a type.
- Every instance of a class contains a separate set of all instance fields of the class.
- An instance function member (method, property, indexer, instance constructor, or finalizer) operates on a given instance of the class, and this instance can be accessed as this (§12.7.8).

[*Example*: The following example illustrates the rules for accessing static and instance members:

```csharp
class Test
{
    int x;
    static int y;

    void F ()
    {
        x = 1; // Ok, same as this.x = 1
        y = 1; // Ok, same as Test.y = 1
    }

    static void G ()
    {
        x = 1; // Error, cannot access this.x
        y = 1; // Ok, same as Test.y = 1
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Test t = new Test ();
        t.x = 1; // Ok
        t.y = 1; // Error, cannot access static member through instance
        Test.x = 1; // Error, cannot access instance member through type
        Test.y = 1; // Ok
    }
}
```

The `F` method shows that in an instance function member, a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) can be used to access both instance members and static members. The `G` method shows that in a static function member, it is a compile-time error to access an instance member through a *simple-name*. The `Main` method shows that in a *member-access* (§12.7.5), instance members shall be accessed through instances, and static members shall be accessed through types. *end example*]

### Nested types

#### General

A type declared within a class or struct is called a ***nested type***. A type that is declared within a compilation unit or namespace is called a ***non-nested type***. [*Example*: In the following example:

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    class B
    {
        static void F ()
        {
            Console.WriteLine ("A.B.F");
        }
    }
}
```

class `B` is a nested type because it is declared within class `A`, and class `A` is a non-nested type because it is declared within a compilation unit. *end example*]

#### Fully qualified name

The fully qualified name (§8.8.3) for a nested type declarationis `S.N` where `S` is the fully qualified name of the type declaration in which type `N` is declared and `N` is the unqualified name (§8.8.2) of the nested type declaration (including any *generic-dimension-specifier* (§12.7.12)).

#### Declared accessibility

Non-nested types can have `public` or `internal` declared accessibility and have `internal` declared accessibility by default. Nested types can have these forms of declared accessibility too, plus one or more additional forms of declared accessibility, depending on whether the containing type is a class or struct:

- A nested type that is declared in a class can have any of five forms of declared accessibility (`public`, `protected internal`, `protected`, `internal`, or `private`) and, like other class members, defaults to `private` declared accessibility.
- A nested type that is declared in a struct can have any of three forms of declared accessibility (`public`, `internal`, or `private`) and, like other struct members, defaults to `private` declared accessibility.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
public class List
{
    // Private data structure
    private class Node
    {
        public object Data;
        public Node Next;
        public Node (object data, Node next)
        {
            this.Data = data;
            this.Next = next;
        }
    }

    private Node first = null;
    private Node last = null;

    // Public interface
    public void AddToFront (object o) {…}
    public void AddToBack (object o) {…}
    public object RemoveFromFront () {…}
    public object RemoveFromBack () {…}
    public int Count { get {…} }
}
```

declares a private nested class `Node`. *end example*]

#### Hiding

A nested type may hide (§8.7.2.2) a base member. The `new` modifier (§15.3.5) is permitted on nested type declarations so that hiding can be expressed explicitly. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Base
{
    public static void M ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Base.M");
    }
}

class Derived : Base
{
    new public class M
    {
        public static void F ()
        {
            Console.WriteLine ("Derived.M.F");
        }
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Derived.M.F ();
    }
}
```

shows a nested class `M` that hides the method `M` defined in `Base`. *end example*]

#### this access

A nested type and its containing type do not have a special relationship with regard to *this-access* (§12.7.8). Specifically, this within a nested type cannot be used to refer to instance members of the containing type. In cases where a nested type needs access to the instance members of its containing type, access can be provided by providing the this for the instance of the containing type as a constructor argument for the nested type. [*Example*: The following example

```csharp
using System;

class C
{
    int i = 123;
    public void F ()
    {
        Nested n = new Nested (this);
        n.G ();
    }

    public class Nested
    {
        C this_c;
        public Nested (C c)
        {
            this_c = c;
        }
        public void G ()
        {
            Console.WriteLine (this_c.i);
        }
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        C c = new C ();
        c.F ();
    }
}
```

shows this technique. An instance of `C` creates an instance of Nested, and passes its own this to `Nested`'s constructor in order to provide subsequent access to `C`'s instance members. *end example*]

#### Access to private and protected members of the containing type

A nested type has access to all of the members that are accessible to its containing type, including members of the containing type that have private and protected declared accessibility. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class C
{
    private static void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("C.F");
    }
    public class Nested
    {
        public static void G ()
        {
            F ();
        }
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        C.Nested.G ();
    }
}
```

shows a class `C` that contains a nested class `Nested`. Within `Nested`, the method `G` calls the static method `F` defined in `C`, and `F` has `private` declared accessibility. *end example*]

A nested type also may access protected members defined in a base type of its containing type. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class Base
{
    protected void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Base.F");
    }
}

class Derived : Base
{
    public class Nested
    {
        public void G ()
        {
            Derived d = new Derived ();
            d.F (); // ok
        }
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Derived.Nested n = new Derived.Nested ();
        n.G ();
    }
}
```

the nested class `Derived.Nested` accesses the `protected` method `F` defined in `Derived`'s base class, `Base`, by calling through an instance of `Derived`. *end example*]

#### Nested types in generic classes

A generic class declaration may contain nested type declarations. The type parameters of the enclosing class may be used within the nested types. A nested type declaration may contain additional type parameters that apply only to the nested type.

Every type declaration contained within a generic class declaration is implicitly a generic type declaration. When writing a reference to a type nested within a generic type, the containing constructed type, including its type arguments, shall be named. However, from within the outer class, the nested type may be used without qualification; the instance type of the outer class may be implicitly used when constructing the nested type. [*Example*: The following shows three different correct ways to refer to a constructed type created from Inner; the first two are equivalent:

```csharp
class Outer<T>
{
    class Inner<U>
    {
        public static void F (T t, U u) {…}
    }

    static void F (T t)
    {
        Outer<T>.Inner<string>.F (t, "abc"); // These two statements have
        Inner<string>.F (t, "abc"); // the same effect

        Outer<int>.Inner<string>.F (3, "abc"); // This type is different

        Outer.Inner<string>.F (t, "abc"); // Error, Outer needs type arg
    }
}
```

*end example*]

Although it is bad programming style, a type parameter in a nested type can hide a member or type parameter declared in the outer type. [*Example*:

```csharp
class Outer<T>
{
    class Inner<T> // Valid, hides Outer’s T
    {
        public T t; // Refers to Inner’s T
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Reserved member names

#### General

To facilitate the underlying C# run-time implementation, for each source member declaration that is a property, event, or indexer, the implementation shall reserve two method signatures based on the kind of the member declaration, its name, and its type (§15.3.10.2, §15.3.10.3, §15.3.10.4). It is a compile-time error for a program to declare a member whose signature matches a signature reserved by a member declared in the same scope, even if the underlying run-time implementation does not make use of these reservations.

The reserved names do not introduce declarations, thus they do not participate in member lookup. However, a declaration’s associated reserved method signatures do participate in inheritance (§15.3.4), and can be hidden with the new modifier (§15.3.5).

[*Note*: The reservation of these names serves three purposes:

1.  To allow the underlying implementation to use an ordinary identifier as a method name for get or set access to the C# language feature.
2.  To allow other languages to interoperate using an ordinary identifier as a method name for get or set access to the C# language feature.
3.  To help ensure that the source accepted by one conforming compiler is accepted by another, by making the specifics of reserved member names consistent across all C# implementations.

*end note*]

The declaration of a finalizer (§15.13) also causes a signature to be reserved (§15.3.10.5).

#### Member names reserved for properties

For a property `P` (§15.7) of type `T`, the following signatures are reserved:

```csharp
T get_P();
void set_P(T value);
```

Both signatures are reserved, even if the property is read-only or write-only.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    public int P
    {
        get { return 123; }
    }
}

class B : A
{
    new public int get_P ()
    {
        return 456;
    }
    new public void set_P (int value)
    { }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b = new B ();
        A a = b;
        Console.WriteLine (a.P);
        Console.WriteLine (b.P);
        Console.WriteLine (b.get_P ());
    }
}
```

a class `A` defines a read-only property `P`, thus reserving signatures for `get_P` and `set_P` methods. A class `B` derives from `A` and hides both of these reserved signatures. The example produces the output:

```plaintext
123
123
456
```

 *end example*]

#### Member names reserved for events

For an event `E` (§15.8) of delegate type `T`, the following signatures are reserved:

```csharp
void add_E(T handler);
void remove_E(T handler);
```

#### Member names reserved for indexers

For an indexer (§15.9) of type `T` with parameter-list `L`, the following signatures are reserved:

```csharp
T get_Item(L);
void set_Item(L, T value);
```

Both signatures are reserved, even if the indexer is read-only or write-only.

Furthermore the member name `Item` is reserved.

#### Member names reserved for finalizers

For a class containing a finalizer (§15.13), the following signature is reserved:

```csharp
void Finalize();
```

## Constants

A ***constant*** is a class member that represents a constant value: a value that can be computed at compile-time. A *constant-declaration* introduces one or more constants of a given type.

```antlr
constant-declaration:
    attributesopt constant-modifiersopt const type constant-declarators ;

constant-modifiers:
    constant-modifier
    constant-modifiers constant-modifier

constant-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private

constant-declarators:
    constant-declarator
    constant-declarators , constant-declarator

constant-declarator:
    identifier = constant-expression
```

A *constant-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22), a new modifier (§15.3.5), and a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6). The attributes and modifiers apply to all of the members declared by the *constant-declaration*. Even though constants are considered static members, a *constant-declaration* neither requires nor allows a static modifier. It is an error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in a constant declaration.

The *type* of a *constant-declaration* specifies the type of the members introduced by the declaration. The type is followed by a list of *constant-declarator*s, each of which introduces a new member. A *constant-declarator* consists of an *identifier* that names the member, followed by an “`=`” token, followed by a *constant-expression* (§12.20) that gives the value of the member.

The *type* specified in a constant declaration shall be `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, `bool`, `string`, an *enum-type*, or a *reference-type*. Each *constant-expression* shall yield a value of the target type or of a type that can be converted to the target type by an implicit conversion (§11.2).

The *type* of a constant shall be at least as accessible as the constant itself (§8.5.5).

The value of a constant is obtained in an expression using a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) or a *member-access* (§12.7.5).

A constant can itself participate in a *constant-expression*. Thus, a constant may be used in any construct that requires a *constant-expression*. 

> [!NOTE]
> Examples of such constructs include case labels, goto case statements, enum member declarations, attributes, and other constant declarations.

> [!NOTE]
> As described in §12.20, a *constant-expression* is an expression that can be fully evaluated at compile-time. Since the only way to create a non-null value of a *reference-type* other than string is to apply the new operator, and since the `new` operator is not permitted in a *constant-expression*, the only possible value for constants of *reference-types* other than string is `null`.

When a symbolic name for a constant value is desired, but when the type of that value is not permitted in a constant declaration, or when the value cannot be computed at compile-time by a *constant-expression*, a `readonly` field (§15.5.3) may be used instead. 

> [!NOTE]
> The versioning semantics of `const` and `readonly` differ (§15.5.3.3).

A constant declaration that declares multiple constants is equivalent to multiple declarations of single constants with the same attributes, modifiers, and type. [*Example*:

```csharp
class A
{
    public const double X = 1.0,
        Y = 2.0,
        Z = 3.0;
}
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
class A
{
    public const double X = 1.0;
    public const double Y = 2.0;
    public const double Z = 3.0;
}
```

*end example*]

Constants are permitted to depend on other constants within the same program as long as the dependencies are not of a circular nature. The compiler automatically arranges to evaluate the constant declarations in the appropriate order. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    public const int X = B.Z + 1;
    public const int Y = 10;
}

class B
{
    public const int Z = A.Y + 1;
}
```

the compiler first evaluates `A.Y`, then evaluates `B.Z`, and finally evaluates `A.X`, producing the values `10`, `11`, and `12`. *end example*] Constant declarations may depend on constants from other programs, but such dependencies are only possible in one direction. [*Example*: Referring to the example above, if `A` and `B` were declared in separate programs, it would be possible for `A.X` to depend on `B.Z`, but `B.Z` could then not simultaneously depend on `A.Y`. *end example*]

## Fields

### General

A ***field*** is a member that represents a variable associated with an object or class. A *field-declaration* introduces one or more fields of a given type.

```antlr
field-declaration:
    attributesopt field-modifiersopt type variable-declarators ;

field-modifiers:
    field-modifier
    field-modifiers field-modifier

field-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    static
    readonly
    volatile

variable-declarators:
    variable-declarator
    variable-declarators , variable-declarator

variable-declarator:
    identifier
    identifier = variable-initializer

variable-initializer:
    expression
    array-initializer
```

A *field-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22), a `new` modifier (§15.3.5), a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6), and a `static` modifier (§15.5.2). In addition, a *field-declaration* may include a `readonly` modifier (§15.5.3) or a `volatile` modifier (§15.5.4), but not both. The attributes and modifiers apply to all of the members declared by the *field-declaration*. It is an error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in a *field declaration*.

The *type* of a *field-declaration* specifies the type of the members introduced by the declaration. The type is followed by a list of *variable-declarator*s, each of which introduces a new member. A *variable-declarator* consists of an *identifier* that names that member, optionally followed by an “`=`” token and a *variable-initializer* (§15.5.6) that gives the initial value of that member.

The *type* of a field shall be at least as accessible as the field itself (§8.5.5).

The value of a field is obtained in an expression using a *simple-name* (§12.7.3), a *member-access* (§12.7.5) or a base-access (§12.7.9). The value of a non-readonly field is modified using an *assignment* (§12.18). The value of a non-readonly field can be both obtained and modified using postfix increment and decrement operators (§12.7.10) and prefix increment and decrement operators (§12.8.6).

A field declaration that declares multiple fields is equivalent to multiple declarations of single fields with the same attributes, modifiers, and type. [*Example*:

```csharp
class A
{
    public static int X = 1, Y, Z = 100;
}
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
class A
{
    public static int X = 1;
    public static int Y;
    public static int Z = 100;
}
```

*end example*]

### Static and instance fields

When a field declaration includes a `static` modifier, the fields introduced by the declaration are ***static fields***. When no `static` modifier is present, the fields introduced by the declaration are ***instance fields***. Static fields and instance fields are two of the several kinds of variables (§10) supported by C#, and at times they are referred to as ***static variables*** and ***instance variables***, respectively.

As explained in §15.3.8, each instance of a class contains a complete set of the instance fields of the class, while there is only one set of static fields for each non-generic class or closed constructed type, regardless of the number of instances of the class or closed constructed type.

### Readonly fields

#### General

When a *field-declaration* includes a `readonly` modifier, the fields introduced by the declaration are ***readonly fields***. Direct assignments to `readonly` fields can only occur as part of that declaration or in an instance constructor or static constructor in the same class. (A `readonly` field can be assigned to multiple times in these contexts.) Specifically, direct assignments to a `readonly` field are permitted only in the following contexts:

- In the *variable-declarator* that introduces the field (by including a *variable-initializer* in the declaration).
- For an instance field, in the instance constructors of the class that contains the field declaration; for a static field, in the static constructor of the class that contains the field declaration. These are also the only contexts in which it is valid to pass a `readonly` field as an `out` or `ref` parameter.

Attempting to assign to a `readonly` field or pass it as an `out` or `ref` parameter in any other context is a compile-time error.

#### Using static readonly fields for constants

A `static readonly` field is useful when a symbolic name for a constant value is desired, but when the type of the value is not permitted in a `const` declaration, or when the value cannot be computed at compile-time. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public class Color
{
    public static readonly Color Black = new Color (0, 0, 0);
    public static readonly Color White = new Color (255, 255, 255);
    public static readonly Color Red = new Color (255, 0, 0);
    public static readonly Color Green = new Color (0, 255, 0);
    public static readonly Color Blue = new Color (0, 0, 255);

    private byte red, green, blue;

    public Color (byte r, byte g, byte b)
    {
        red = r;
        green = g;
        blue = b;
    }
}
```

the `Black`, `White`, `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue` members cannot be declared as const members because their values cannot be computed at compile-time. However, declaring them `static readonly` instead has much the same effect. *end example*]

#### Versioning of constants and static readonly fields

Constants and readonly fields have different binary versioning semantics. When an expression references a constant, the value of the constant is obtained at compile-time, but when an expression references a readonly field, the value of the field is not obtained until run-time. [*Example*: Consider an application that consists of two separate programs:

```csharp
namespace Program1
{
    public class Utils
    {
        public static readonly int X = 1;
    }
}
```

and

```csharp
using System;

namespace Program2
{
    class Test
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine (Program1.Utils.X);
        }
    }
}
```

The `Program1` and `Program2` namespaces denote two programs that are compiled separately. Because `Program1.Utils.X` is declared as a `static readonly` field, the value output by the `Console.WriteLine` statement is not known at compile-time, but rather is obtained at run-time. Thus, if the value of `X` is changed and `Program1` is recompiled, the `Console.WriteLine` statement will output the new value even if `Program2` isn’t recompiled. However, had `X` been a constant, the value of `X` would have been obtained at the time `Program2` was compiled, and would remain unaffected by changes in `Program1` until `Program2` is recompiled. *end example*]

### Volatile fields

When a *field-declaration* includes a `volatile` modifier, the fields introduced by that declaration are ***volatile fields***. For non-volatile fields, optimization techniques that reorder instructions can lead to unexpected and unpredictable results in multi-threaded programs that access fields without synchronization such as that provided by the *lock-statement* (§13.13). These optimizations can be performed by the compiler, by the run-time system, or by hardware. For `volatile` fields, such reordering optimizations are restricted:

- A read of a volatile field is called a ***volatile read***. A volatile read has “acquire semantics”; that is, it is guaranteed to occur prior to any references to memory that occur after it in the instruction sequence.
- A write of a volatile field is called a ***volatile write***. A volatile write has “release semantics”; that is, it is guaranteed to happen after any memory references prior to the write instruction in the instruction sequence.

These restrictions ensure that all threads will observe volatile writes performed by any other thread in the order in which they were performed. A conforming implementation is not required to provide a single total ordering of volatile writes as seen from all threads of execution. The type of a volatile field shall be one of the following:

- A *reference-type*.
- A *type-parameter* that is known to be a reference type (§15.2.5).
- The type `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `char`, `float`, `bool`, `System.IntPtr`, or `System.UIntPtr`.
- An *enum-type* having an enum base type of `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, or `uint`.

> [*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Test
{
    public static int result;
    public static volatile bool finished;

    static void Thread2 ()
    {
        result = 143;
        finished = true;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        finished = false;
        // Run Thread2() in a new thread
        new Thread (new ThreadStart (Thread2)).Start ();
        // Wait for Thread2 to signal that it has a result by setting
        // finished to true.
        for (;;)
        {
            if (finished)
            {
                Console.WriteLine ("result = {0}", result);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

produces the output:

```plaintext
result = 143
```

In this example, the method `Main` starts a new thread that runs the method `Thread2`. This method stores a value into a non-volatile field called `result`, then stores true in the volatile field finished. The main thread waits for the field finished to be set to `true`, then reads the field `result`. Since finished has been declared volatile, the main thread shall read the value `143` from the field `result`. If the field finished had not been declared `volatile`, then it would be permissible for the store to result to be visible to the main thread *after* the store to finished, and hence for the main thread to read the value `0` from the field `result`. Declaring finished as a volatile field prevents any such inconsistency. *end example*]

### Field initialization

The initial value of a field, whether it be a static field or an instance field, is the default value (§10.3) of the field’s type. It is not possible to observe the value of a field before this default initialization has occurred, and a field is thus never “uninitialized”. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static bool b;
    int i;

    static void Main()
    {
        Test t = new Test ();
        Console.WriteLine ("b = {0}, i = {1}", b, t.i);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
b = False, i = 0
```

because `b` and `i` are both automatically initialized to default values. *end example*]

### Variable initializers

#### General

Field declarations may include *variable-initializer*s. For static fields, variable initializers correspond to assignment statements that are executed during class initialization. For instance fields, variable initializers correspond to assignment statements that are executed when an instance of the class is created.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static double x = Math.Sqrt (2.0);
    int i = 100;
    string s = "Hello";

    static void Main()
    {
        Test a = new Test ();
        Console.WriteLine ("x = {0}, i = {1}, s = {2}", x, a.i, a.s);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
x = 1.4142135623731, i = 100, s = Hello
```

because an assignment to `x` occurs when static field initializers execute and assignments to `i` and `s` occur when the instance field initializers execute. *end example*]

The default value initialization described in §15.5.5 occurs for all fields, including fields that have variable initializers. Thus, when a class is initialized, all static fields in that class are first initialized to their default values, and then the static field initializers are executed in textual order. Likewise, when an instance of a class is created, all instance fields in that instance are first initialized to their default values, and then the instance field initializers are executed in textual order. When there are field declarations in multiple partial type declarations for the same type, the order of the parts is unspecified. However, within each part the field initializers are executed in order.

It is possible for static fields with variable initializers to be observed in their default value state. [*Example*: However, this is strongly discouraged as a matter of style. The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static int a = b + 1;
    static int b = a + 1;

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("a = {0}, b = {1}", a, b);
    }
}
```

exhibits this behavior. Despite the circular definitions of `a` and `b`, the program is valid. It results in the output

```plaintext
a = 1, b = 2
```

because the static fields a and b are initialized to `0` (the default value for `int`) before their initializers are executed. When the initializer for a runs, the value of `b` is zero, and so a is initialized to `1`. When the initializer for `b` runs, the value of `a` is already `1`, and so `b` is initialized to `2`. *end example*]

#### Static field initialization

The static field variable initializers of a class correspond to a sequence of assignments that are executed in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration (§15.5.6.1). Within a partial class, the meaning of "textual order" is specified by §15.5.6.1. If a static constructor (§15.12) exists in the class, execution of the static field initializers occurs immediately prior to executing that static constructor. Otherwise, the static field initializers are executed at an implementation-dependent time prior to the first use of a static field of that class. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("{0} {1}", B.Y, A.X);
    }
    public static int F (string s)
    {
        Console.WriteLine (s);
        return 1;
    }
}

class A
{
    public static int X = Test.F ("Init A");
}

class B
{
    public static int Y = Test.F ("Init B");
}
```

might produce either the output:

```plaintext
Init A
Init B
1 1
```

or the output:

```plaintext
Init B
Init A
1 1
```

because the execution of `X`'s initializer and `Y`'s initializer could occur in either order; they are only constrained to occur before the references to those fields. However, in the example:

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("{0} {1}", B.Y, A.X);
    }
    public static int F (string s)
    {
        Console.WriteLine (s);
        return 1;
    }
}

class A
{
    static A () { }
    public static int X = Test.F ("Init A");
}

class B
{
    static B () { }
    public static int Y = Test.F ("Init B");
}
```

the output shall be:

```plaintext
Init B
Init A
1 1
```

because the rules for when static constructors execute (as defined in §15.12) provide that `B`'s static constructor (and hence `B`'s static field initializers) shall run before `A`'s static constructor and field initializers. *end example*]

#### Instance field initialization

The instance field variable initializers of a class correspond to a sequence of assignments that are executed immediately upon entry to any one of the instance constructors (§15.11.3) of that class. Within a partial class, the meaning of "textual order" is specified by §15.5.6.1. The variable initializers are executed in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration (§15.5.6.1). The class instance creation and initialization process is described further in §15.11.

A variable initializer for an instance field cannot reference the instance being created. Thus, it is a compile-time error to reference this in a variable initializer, as it is a compile-time error for a variable initializer to reference any instance member through a *simple-name*. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    int x = 1;
    int y = x + 1; // Error, reference to instance member of this
}
```

the variable initializer for `y` results in a compile-time error because it references a member of the instance being created. *end example*]

## Methods

### General

A ***method*** is a member that implements a computation or action that can be performed by an object or class. Methods are declared using *method-declaration*s:

```antlr
method-declaration:
    method-header method-body

method-header:
    attributesopt method-modifiersopt partialopt return-type member-name
    type-parameter-listopt
    ( formal-parameter-listopt ) type-parameter-constraints-clausesopt

method-modifiers:
    method-modifier
    method-modifiers method-modifier

method-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    static
    virtual
    sealed
    override
    abstract
    extern
    async

return-type:
    type
    void

member-name:
    identifier
    interface-type . identifier

method-body:
    block
    ;
```

A *method-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22) and a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6), the `new` (§15.3.5), `static` (§15.6.3), `virtual` (§15.6.4), `override` (§15.6.5), `sealed` (§15.6.6), `abstract` (§15.6.7), `extern` (§15.6.8) and `async` (§15.15) modifiers.

A declaration has a valid combination of modifiers if all of the following are true:

- The declaration includes a valid combination of access modifiers (§15.3.6).
- The declaration does not include the same modifier multiple times.
- The declaration includes at most one of the following modifiers: `static`, `virtual`, and `override`.
- The declaration includes at most one of the following modifiers: `new` and `override`.
- If the declaration includes the `abstract` modifier, then the declaration does not include any of the following modifiers: `static`, `virtual`, `sealed`, or `extern`.
- If the declaration includes the `private` modifier, then the declaration does not include any of the following modifiers: `virtual`, `override`, or `abstract`.
- If the declaration includes the `sealed` modifier, then the declaration also includes the `override` modifier.
- If the declaration includes the `partial` modifier, then it does not include any of the following modifiers: `new`, `public`, `protected`, `internal`, `private`, `virtual`, `sealed`, `override`, `abstract`, or `extern`.

The *return-type* of a method declaration specifies the type of the value computed and returned by the method. The *return-type* is `void` if the method does not return a value. If the declaration includes the `partial` modifier, then the return type shall be `void`.

A generic method is a method whose declaration includes a *type-parameter-list*. This specifies the type parameters for the method. The optional *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* specify the constraints for the type parameters. A *method-declaration* shall not have *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* unless it also has a *type-parameter-list*. A *method-declaration* for an explicit interface member implementation shall not have any *type-parameter-constraints-clauses*. A generic *method-declaration* for an explicit interface member implementation inherits any constraints from the constraints on the interface method. Similarly, a method declaration with the override modifier shall not have any *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* and the constraints of the method’s type parameters are inherited from the virtual method being overridden.The *member-name* specifies the name of the method. Unless the method is an explicit interface member implementation (§18.6.2), the *member-name* is simply an *identifier*. For an explicit interface member implementation, the *member-name* consists of an *interface-type* followed by a “.” and an *identifier*. In this case, the declaration shall include no modifiers other than (possibly) extern or async.

The optional *formal-parameter-list* specifies the parameters of the method (§15.6.2).

The *return-type* and each of the types referenced in the *formal-parameter-list* of a method shall be at least as accessible as the method itself (§8.5.5).

For `abstract` and `extern` methods, the *method-body* consists simply of a semicolon. For partial methods the *method-body* may consist of either a semicolon or a *block*. For all other methods, the *method-body* consists of a *block,* which specifies the statements to execute when the method is invoked.

If the *method-body* consists of a semicolon, the declaration shall not include the `async` modifier.

The name, the number of type parameters, and the formal parameter list of a method define the signature (§8.6) of the method. Specifically, the signature of a method consists of its name, the number of its type parameters, and the number, *parameter-mode-modifier*s (§15.6.2.1), and types of its formal parameters. The return type is not part of a method’s signature, nor are the names of the formal parameters, the names of the type parameters, or the constraints. When a formal parameter type references a type parameter of the method, the ordinal position of the type parameter (not the name of the type parameter) is used for type equivalence.

The name of a method shall differ from the names of all other non-methods declared in the same class. In addition, the signature of a method shall differ from the signatures of all other methods declared in the same class, and two methods declared in the same class may not have signatures that differ solely by ref and out.

The method’s *type-parameter*s are in scope throughout the *method-declaration*, and can be used to form types throughout that scope in *return-type*, *method-body*, and *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* but not in *attributes*.

All formal parameters and type parameters shall have different names.

### Method parameters

#### General

The parameters of a method, if any, are declared by the method’s *formal-parameter-list*.

```antlr
formal-parameter-list:
    fixed-parameters
    fixed-parameters , parameter-array
    parameter-array

fixed-parameters:
    fixed-parameter
    fixed-parameters , fixed-parameter

fixed-parameter:
    attributesopt parameter-modifieropt type identifier default-argumentopt

default-argument:
    = expression

parameter-modifier:
    parameter-mode-modifier
    this

parameter-mode-modifier:
    ref
    out

parameter-array:
    attributesopt params array-type identifier
```

The formal parameter list consists of one or more comma-separated parameters of which only the last may be a *parameter-array*.

A *fixed-parameter* consists of an optional set of *attributes* (§22); an optional `ref`, `out`, or `this` modifier; a *type*; an *identifier*; and an optional *default-argument*. Each *fixed-parameter* declares a parameter of the given type with the given name. The `this` modifier designates the method as an extension method and is only allowed on the first parameter of a static method in a non-generic, non-nested static class. Extension methods are further described in §15.6.10. A *fixed-parameter* with a *default-argument* is known as an ***optional parameter***, whereas a *fixed-parameter* without a *default-argument* is a ***required parameter***. A required parameter may not appear after an optional parameter in a *formal-parameter-list*.

A parameter with a `ref`, `out` or `this` modifier cannot have a *default-argument*. The *expression* in a *default-argument* shall be one of the following:

- a *constant-expression*
- an expression of the form `new S()` where `S` is a value type
- an expression of the form `default(S)` where `S` is a value type

The *expression* shall be implicitly convertible by an identity or nullable conversion to the type of the parameter.

If optional parameters occur in an implementing partial method declaration (§15.6.9), an explicit interface member implementation (§18.6.2), a single-parameter indexer declaration (§15.9), or in an operator declaration (§15.10.1) the compiler should give a warning, since these members can never be invoked in a way that permits arguments to be omitted.

A *parameter-array* consists of an optional set of *attributes* (§22), a params modifier, an *array-type*, and an *identifier*. A parameter array declares a single parameter of the given array type with the given name. The *array-type* of a parameter array shall be a single-dimensional array type (§17.2). In a method invocation, a parameter array permits either a single argument of the given array type to be specified, or it permits zero or more arguments of the array element type to be specified. Parameter arrays are described further in §15.6.2.5.

A *parameter-array* may occur after an optional parameter, but cannot have a default value – the omission of arguments for a *parameter-array* would instead result in the creation of an empty array.

[*Example*: The following illustrates different kinds of parameters:

```csharp
public void M (
    ref int i,
    decimal d,
    bool b = false,
    bool? n = false,
    string s = "Hello",
    object o = null,
    T t = default (T),
    params int[] a
) { }
```

In the *formal-parameter-list* for `M`, `i` is a required `ref` parameter, `d` is a required value parameter, `b`, `s`, `o` and `t` are optional value parameters and `a` is a parameter array. *end example*]

A method declaration creates a separate declaration space (§8.3) for parameters and type parameters. Names are introduced into this declaration space by the type parameter list and the formal parameter list of the method. The body of the method, if any, is considered to be nested within this declaration space. It is an error for two members of a method declaration space to have the same name. It is an error for the method declaration space and the local variable declaration space of a nested declaration space to contain elements with the same name.

A method invocation (§12.7.6.2) creates a copy, specific to that invocation, of the formal parameters and local variables of the method, and the argument list of the invocation assigns values or variable references to the newly created formal parameters. Within the *block* of a method, formal parameters can be referenced by their identifiers in *simple-name* expressions (§12.7.3).

There are four kinds of formal parameters:

- Value parameters, which are declared without any modifiers.
- Reference parameters, which are declared with the `ref` modifier.
- Output parameters, which are declared with the `out` modifier.
- Parameter arrays, which are declared with the `params` modifier.

> [!NOTE]
> As described in §8.6, the `ref` and `out` modifiers are part of a method’s signature, but the `params` modifier is not.

#### Value parameters

A parameter declared with no modifiers is a value parameter. A value parameter corresponds to a local variable that gets its initial value from the corresponding argument supplied in the method invocation.

When a formal parameter is a value parameter, the corresponding argument in a method invocation shall be an expression that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the formal parameter type.

A method is permitted to assign new values to a value parameter. Such assignments only affect the local storage location represented by the value parameter—they have no effect on the actual argument given in the method invocation.

#### Reference parameters

A parameter declared with a `ref` modifier is a reference parameter. Unlike a value parameter, a reference parameter does not create a new storage location. Instead, a reference parameter represents the same storage location as the variable given as the argument in the method invocation.

When a formal parameter is a reference parameter, the corresponding argument in a method invocation shall consist of the keyword `ref` followed by a *variable-reference* (§10.5) of the same type as the formal parameter. A variable shall be definitely assigned before it can be passed as a reference parameter.

Within a method, a reference parameter is always considered definitely assigned.

A method declared as an iterator (§15.14) may not have reference parameters.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Swap (ref int x, ref int y)
    {
        int temp = x;
        x = y;
        y = temp;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 1, j = 2;
        Swap (ref i, ref j);
        Console.WriteLine ("i = {0}, j = {1}", i, j);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
i = 2, j = 1
```

For the invocation of `Swap` in `Main`, `x` represents `i` and `y` represents `j`. Thus, the invocation has the effect of swapping the values of `i` and `j`. *end example*]

In a method that takes reference parameters, it is possible for multiple names to represent the same storage location. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    string s;

    void F (ref string a, ref string b)
    {
        s = "One";
        a = "Two";
        b = "Three";
    }

    void G ()
    {
        F (ref s, ref s);
    }
}
```

the invocation of `F` in `G` passes a reference to `s` for both `a` and `b`. Thus, for that invocation, the names `s`, `a`, and `b` all refer to the same storage location, and the three assignments all modify the instance field `s`. *end example*]

#### Output parameters

A parameter declared with an `out` modifier is an output parameter. Similar to a reference parameter, an output parameter does not create a new storage location. Instead, an output parameter represents the same storage location as the variable given as the argument in the method invocation.

When a formal parameter is an output parameter, the corresponding argument in a method invocation shall consist of the keyword `out` followed by a *variable-reference* (§10.5) of the same type as the formal parameter. A variable need not be definitely assigned before it can be passed as an output parameter, but following an invocation where a variable was passed as an output parameter, the variable is considered definitely assigned.

Within a method, just like a local variable, an output parameter is initially considered unassigned and shall be definitely assigned before its value is used.

Every output parameter of a method shall be definitely assigned before the method returns.

A method declared as a partial method (§15.6.9) or an iterator (§15.14) may not have output parameters.

Output parameters are typically used in methods that produce multiple return values. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void SplitPath (string path, out string dir, out string name)
    {
        int i = path.Length;
        while (i > 0)
        {
            char ch = path[i– 1];
            if (ch == '\\' || ch == '/' || ch == ':') break;
            i--;
        }
        dir = path.Substring (0, i);
        name = path.Substring (i);
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        string dir, name;
        SplitPath ("c:\\Windows\\System\\hello.txt", out dir, out name);
        Console.WriteLine (dir);
        Console.WriteLine (name);
    }
}
```

The example produces the output:

```plaintext
c:\\Windows\\System\\
hello.txt
```

Note that the `dir` and `name` variables can be unassigned before they are passed to `SplitPath`, and that they are considered definitely assigned following the call. *end example*]

#### Parameter arrays

A parameter declared with a `params` modifier is a parameter array. If a formal parameter list includes a parameter array, it shall be the last parameter in the list and it shall be of a single-dimensional array type. [*Example*: The types `string[]` and `string[][]` can be used as the type of a parameter array, but the type `string[,]` can not. *end example*] It is not possible to combine the `params` modifier with the modifiers `ref` and `out`.

A parameter array permits arguments to be specified in one of two ways in a method invocation:

- The argument given for a parameter array can be a single expression that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the parameter array type. In this case, the parameter array acts precisely like a value parameter.
- Alternatively, the invocation can specify zero or more arguments for the parameter array, where each argument is an expression that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the element type of the parameter array. In this case, the invocation creates an instance of the parameter array type with a length corresponding to the number of arguments, initializes the elements of the array instance with the given argument values, and uses the newly created array instance as the actual argument.

Except for allowing a variable number of arguments in an invocation, a parameter array is precisely equivalent to a value parameter (§15.6.2.2) of the same type.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void F (params int[] args)
    {
        Console.Write ("Array contains {0} elements:", args.Length);
        foreach (int i in args)
            Console.Write (" {0}", i);
        Console.WriteLine ();
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3 };
        F (arr);
        F (10, 20, 30, 40);
        F ();
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
Array contains 3 elements: 1 2 3
Array contains 4 elements: 10 20 30 40
Array contains 0 elements:
```

The first invocation of `F` simply passes the array `arr` as a value parameter. The second invocation of `F` automatically creates a four-element `int[]` with the given element values and passes that array instance as a value parameter. Likewise, the third invocation of `F` creates a zero-element `int[]` and passes that instance as a value parameter. The second and third invocations are precisely equivalent to writing:

```csharp
F(new int[] {10, 20, 30, 40});
F(new int[] {});
```

*end example*]

When performing overload resolution, a method with a parameter array might be applicable, either in its normal form or in its expanded form (§12.6.4.2). The expanded form of a method is available only if the normal form of the method is not applicable and only if an applicable method with the same signature as the expanded form is not already declared in the same type.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void F (params object[] a)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("F(object[])");
    }

    static void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("F()");
    }

    static void F (object a0, object a1)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("F(object,object)");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        F ();
        F (1);
        F (1, 2);
        F (1, 2, 3);
        F (1, 2, 3, 4);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
F();
F(object[]);
F(object,object);
F(object[]);
F(object[]);
```

In the example, two of the possible expanded forms of the method with a parameter array are already included in the class as regular methods. These expanded forms are therefore not considered when performing overload resolution, and the first and third method invocations thus select the regular methods. When a class declares a method with a parameter array, it is not uncommon to also include some of the expanded forms as regular methods. By doing so, it is possible to avoid the allocation of an array instance that occurs when an expanded form of a method with a parameter array is invoked. *end example*]

When the type of a parameter array is `object[]`, a potential ambiguity arises between the normal form of the method and the expanded form for a single object parameter. The reason for the ambiguity is that an `object[]` is itself implicitly convertible to type `object`. The ambiguity presents no problem, however, since it can be resolved by inserting a cast if needed.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void F (params object[] args)
    {
        foreach (object o in args)
        {
            Console.Write (o.GetType ().FullName);
            Console.Write (" ");
        }
        Console.WriteLine ();
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        object[] a = { 1, "Hello", 123.456 };
        object o = a;
        F (a);
        F ((object) a);
        F (o);
        F ((object[]) o);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
System.Int32 System.String System.Double
System.Object[]
System.Object[]
System.Int32 System.String System.Double
```

In the first and last invocations of F, the normal form of `F` is applicable because an implicit conversion exists from the argument type to the parameter type (both are of type `object[]`). Thus, overload resolution selects the normal form of `F`, and the argument is passed as a regular value parameter. In the second and third invocations, the normal form of `F` is not applicable because no implicit conversion exists from the argument type to the parameter type (type `object` cannot be implicitly converted to type `object[]`). However, the expanded form of `F` is applicable, so it is selected by overload resolution. As a result, a one-element `object[]` is created by the invocation, and the single element of the array is initialized with the given argument value (which itself is a reference to an `object[]`). *end example*]

### Static and instance methods

When a method declaration includes a `static` modifier, that method is said to be a static method. When no `static` modifier is present, the method is said to be an instance method.

A static method does not operate on a specific instance, and it is a compile-time error to refer to this in a static method.

An instance method operates on a given instance of a class, and that instance can be accessed as this (§12.7.8).

The differences between static and instance members are discussed further in §15.3.8.

### Virtual methods

When an instance method declaration includes a `virtual` modifier, that method is said to be a ***virtual method***. When no `virtual` modifier is present, the method is said to be a ***non-virtual method***.

The implementation of a non-virtual method is invariant: The implementation is the same whether the method is invoked on an instance of the class in which it is declared or an instance of a derived class. In contrast, the implementation of a virtual method can be superseded by derived classes. The process of superseding the implementation of an inherited virtual method is known as ***overriding*** that method (§15.6.5).

In a virtual method invocation, the ***run-time type*** of the instance for which that invocation takes place determines the actual method implementation to invoke. In a non-virtual method invocation, the ***compile-time type*** of the instance is the determining factor. In precise terms, when a method named N is invoked with an argument list A on an instance with a compile-time type C and a run-time type R (where R is either C or a class derived from C), the invocation is processed as follows:

- At binding-time, overload resolution is applied to `C`, `N`, and `A`, to select a specific method `M` from the set of methods declared in and inherited by `C. This is described in §12.7.6.2.
- Then at run-time:
  - If `M` is a non-virtual method, `M` is invoked.
  - Otherwise, `M` is a virtual method, and the most derived implementation of `M` with respect to `R` is invoked.

For every virtual method declared in or inherited by a class, there exists a ***most derived implementation*** of the method with respect to that class. The most derived implementation of a virtual method `M` with respect to a class `R` is determined as follows:

- If `R` contains the introducing virtual declaration of `M`, then this is the most derived implementation of `M` with respect to `R`.
- Otherwise, if `R` contains an override of `M`, then this is the most derived implementation of M with respect to `R`.
- Otherwise, the most derived implementation of M with respect to `R` is the same as the most derived implementation of `M` with respect to the direct base class of `R`.

[*Example*: The following example illustrates the differences between virtual and non-virtual methods:

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    public void F () { Console.WriteLine ("A.F"); }
    public virtual void G () { Console.WriteLine ("A.G"); }
}

class B : A
{
    new public void F () { Console.WriteLine ("B.F"); }
    public override void G () { Console.WriteLine ("B.G"); }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b = new B ();
        A a = b;
        a.F ();
        b.F ();
        a.G ();
        b.G ();
    }
}
```

In the example, `A` introduces a non-virtual method `F` and a virtual method `G`. The class `B` introduces a *new* non-virtual method `F, thus *hiding* the inherited `F`, and also *overrides* the inherited method `G`. The example produces the output:

```plaintext
A.F
B.F
B.G
B.G
```

Notice that the statement `a.G()` invokes `B.G,` not `A.G`. This is because the run-time type of the instance (which is `B`), not the compile-time type of the instance (which is `A`), determines the actual method implementation to invoke. *end example*]

Because methods are allowed to hide inherited methods, it is possible for a class to contain several virtual methods with the same signature. This does not present an ambiguity problem, since all but the most derived method are hidden. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    public virtual void F () { Console.WriteLine ("A.F"); }
}

class B : A
{
    public override void F () { Console.WriteLine ("B.F"); }
}

class C : B
{
    new public virtual void F () { Console.WriteLine ("C.F"); }
}

class D : C
{
    public override void F () { Console.WriteLine ("D.F"); }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        D d = new D ();
        A a = d;
        B b = d;
        C c = d;
        a.F ();
        b.F ();
        c.F ();
        d.F ();
    }
}
```

the `C` and `D` classes contain two virtual methods with the same signature: The one introduced by `A` and the one introduced by `C`. The method introduced by `C` hides the method inherited from `A`. Thus, the override declaration in `D` overrides the method introduced by `C`, and it is not possible for `D` to override the method introduced by `A`. The example produces the output:

```plaintext
B.F
B.F
D.F
D.F
```

Note that it is possible to invoke the hidden virtual method by accessing an instance of `D` through a less derived type in which the method is not hidden. *end example*]

### Override methods

When an instance method declaration includes an `override` modifier, the method is said to be an ***override method***. An override method overrides an inherited virtual method with the same signature. Whereas a virtual method declaration *introduces* a new method, an override method declaration *specializes* an existing inherited virtual method by providing a new implementation of that method.

The method overridden by an `override` declaration is known as the ***overridden base method*** For an override method `M` declared in a class `C`, the overridden base method is determined by examining each base class of `C`, starting with the direct base class of `C` and continuing with each successive direct base class, until in a given base class type at least one accessible method is located which has the same signature as `M` after substitution of type arguments. For the purposes of locating the overridden base method, a method is considered accessible if it is `public`, if it is `protected`, if it is `protected internal`, or if it is `internal` and declared in the same program as `C`.

A compile-time error occurs unless all of the following are true for an `override` declaration:

- An overridden base method can be located as described above.
- There is exactly one such overridden base method. This restriction has effect only if the base class type is a constructed type where the substitution of type arguments makes the signature of two methods the same.
- The overridden base method is a `virtual`, `abstract`, or `override` method. In other words, the overridden base method cannot be `static` or non-virtual.
- The overridden base method is not a `sealed` method.
- There is an identity conversion between the return type of the overridden base method and the override method.
- The `override` declaration and the overridden base method have the same declared accessibility. In other words, an `override` declaration cannot change the accessibility of the virtual method. However, if the overridden base method is `protected internal` and it is declared in a different assembly than the assembly containing the `override` declaration then the `override` declaration’s declared accessibility shall be `protected`.
- The `override` declaration does not specify type-parameter-constraints-clauses. Instead, the constraints are inherited from the overridden base method. Constraints that are type parameters in the overridden method may be replaced by type arguments in the inherited constraint. This can lead to constraints that are not valid when explicitly specified, such as value types or sealed types.

[*Example*: The following demonstrates how the overriding rules work for generic classes:

```csharp
abstract class C<T>
{
    public virtual T F () {…}

    public virtual C<T> G () {…}

    public virtual void H (C<T> x) {…}
}

class D : C<string>
{
    public override string F () {…} // Ok

    public override C<string> G () {…} // Ok

    public override void H (C<T> x) {…} // Error, should be C<string>
}

class E<T, U> : C<U>
{
    public override U F () {…} // Ok

    public override C<U> G () {…} // Ok

    public override void H (C<T> x) {…} // Error, should be C<U>
}
```

*end example*]

An override declaration can access the overridden base method using a *base-access* (§12.7.9). [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    int x;

    public virtual void PrintFields ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("x = {0}", x);
    }
}

class B : A
{
    int y;

    public override void PrintFields ()
    {
        base.PrintFields ();
        Console.WriteLine ("y = {0}", y);
    }
}
```

the `base.PrintFields()` invocation in `B` invokes the `PrintFields` method declared in `A`. A *base-access* disables the virtual invocation mechanism and simply treats the base method as a non-virtual method. Had the invocation in `B` been written `((A)this).PrintFields()`, it would recursively invoke the `PrintFields` method declared in `B`, not the one declared in `A`, since `PrintFields` is `virtual` and the run-time type of `((A)this)` is `B`. *end example*]

Only by including an `override` modifier can a method override another method. In all other cases, a method with the same signature as an inherited method simply hides the inherited method. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    public virtual void F () { }
}

class B : A
{
    public virtual void F () { } // Warning, hiding inherited F()
}
```

the `F` method in `B` does not include an `override` modifier and therefore does not override the `F` method in `A`. Rather, the `F` method in `B` hides the method in `A`, and a warning is reported because the declaration does not include a `new` modifier. *end example*]

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    public virtual void F () { }
}

class B : A
{
    new private void F () { } // Hides A.F within body of B
}

class C : B
{
    public override void F () { } // Ok, overrides A.F
}
```

the `F` method in `B` hides the virtual `F` method inherited from `A`. Since the new `F` in `B` has `private` access, its scope only includes the class body of `B` and does not extend to `C`. Therefore, the declaration of `F` in `C` is permitted to override the `F` inherited from `A`. *end example*]

### Sealed methods

When an instance method declaration includes a `sealed` modifier, that method is said to be a ***sealed method***. A sealed method overrides an inherited virtual method with the same signature. A sealed method shall also be marked with the `override` modifier. Use of the `sealed` modifier prevents a derived class from further overriding the method.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    public virtual void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("A.F");
    }

    public virtual void G ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("A.G");
    }
}

class B : A
{
    public sealed override void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("B.F");
    }

    public override void G ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("B.G");
    }
}

class C : B
{
    public override void G ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("C.G");
    }
}
```

the class `B` provides two override methods: an `F` method that has the `sealed` modifier and a `G` method that does not. `B`’s use of the `sealed` modifier prevents `C` from further overriding `F`. *end example*]

### Abstract methods

When an instance method declaration includes an `abstract` modifier, that method is said to be an ***abstract method***. Although an abstract method is implicitly also a virtual method, it cannot have the modifier `virtual`.

An abstract method declaration introduces a new virtual method but does not provide an implementation of that method. Instead, non-abstract derived classes are required to provide their own implementation by overriding that method. Because an abstract method provides no actual implementation, the *method-body* of an abstract method simply consists of a semicolon.

Abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes (§15.2.2.2).

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract void Paint (Graphics g, Rectangle r);
}

public class Ellipse : Shape
{
    public override void Paint (Graphics g, Rectangle r)
    {
        g.DrawEllipse (r);
    }
}

public class Box : Shape
{
    public override void Paint (Graphics g, Rectangle r)
    {
        g.DrawRect (r);
    }
}
```

the `Shape` class defines the abstract notion of a geometrical shape object that can paint itself. The `Paint` method is abstract because there is no meaningful default implementation. The `Ellipse` and `Box` classes are concrete `Shape` implementations. Because these classes are non-abstract, they are required to override the `Paint` method and provide an actual implementation. *end example*]

It is a compile-time error for a *base-access* (§12.7.9) to reference an abstract method. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
abstract class A
{
    public abstract void F ();
}

class B : A
{
    public override void F ()
    {
        base.F (); // Error, base.F is abstract
    }
}
```

a compile-time error is reported for the `base.F()` invocation because it references an abstract method. *end example*]

An abstract method declaration is permitted to override a virtual method. This allows an abstract class to force re-implementation of the method in derived classes, and makes the original implementation of the method unavailable. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    public virtual void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("A.F");
    }
}

abstract class B : A
{
    public abstract override void F ();
}

class C : B
{
    public override void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("C.F");
    }
}
```

class `A` declares a virtual method, class `B` overrides this method with an abstract method, and class `C` overrides the abstract method to provide its own implementation. *end example*]

### External methods

When a method declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the method is said to be an ***external method***. External methods are implemented externally, typically using a language other than C#. Because an external method declaration provides no actual implementation, the *method-body* of an external method simply consists of a semicolon. An external method shall not be generic.

The mechanism by which linkage to an external method is achieved, is implementation-defined.

[*Example*: The following example demonstrates the use of the `extern` modifier and the DllImport attribute:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Security.Permissions;
using System.Text;

class Path
{
    [DllImport ("kernel32", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern bool CreateDirectory (string name, SecurityAttribute sa);

    [DllImport ("kernel32", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern bool RemoveDirectory (string name);

    [DllImport ("kernel32", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern int GetCurrentDirectory (int bufSize, StringBuilder buf);

    [DllImport ("kernel32", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern bool SetCurrentDirectory (string name);
}
```

*end example*]

### Partial methods

When a method declaration includes a `partial` modifier, that method is said to be a ***partial method***. Partial methods may only be declared as members of partial types (§15.2.7), and are subject to a number of restrictions.

Partial methods may be defined in one part of a type declaration and implemented in another. The implementation is optional; if no part implements the partial method, the partial method declaration and all calls to it are removed from the type declaration resulting from the combination of the parts.

Partial methods shall not define access modifiers; they are implicitly `private`. Their return type shall be `void`, and their parameters shall not have the `out` modifier. The identifier partial is recognized as a contextual keyword (§7.4.4) in a method declaration only if it appears immediately before the `void` keyword. A partial method cannot explicitly implement interface methods.

There are two kinds of partial method declarations: If the body of the method declaration is a semicolon, the declaration is said to be a ***defining partial method declaration***. If the body is given as a *block*, the declaration is said to be an ***implementing partial method declaration***. Across the parts of a type declaration, there may be only one defining partial method declaration with a given signature, and there may be only one implementing partial method declaration with a given signature. If an implementing partial method declaration is given, a corresponding defining partial method declaration shall exist, and the declarations shall match as specified in the following:

- The declarations shall have the same modifiers (although not necessarily in the same order), method name, number of type parameters and number of parameters.
- Corresponding parameters in the declarations shall have the same modifiers (although not necessarily in the same order) and the same types (modulo differences in type parameter names).
- Corresponding type parameters in the declarations shall have the same constraints (modulo differences in type parameter names).

An implementing partial method declaration can appear in the same part as the corresponding defining partial method declaration.

Only a defining partial method participates in overload resolution. Thus, whether or not an implementing declaration is given, invocation expressions may resolve to invocations of the partial method. Because a partial method always returns void, such invocation expressions will always be expression statements. Furthermore, because a partial method is implicitly `private`, such statements will always occur within one of the parts of the type declaration within which the partial method is declared.

If no part of a partial type declaration contains an implementing declaration for a given partial method, any expression statement invoking it is simply removed from the combined type declaration. Thus the invocation expression, including any subexpressions, has no effect at run-time. The partial method itself is also removed and will not be a member of the combined type declaration.

If an implementing declaration exists for a given partial method, the invocations of the partial methods are retained. The partial method gives rise to a method declaration similar to the implementing partial method declaration except for the following:

- The partial modifier is not included
- The attributes in the resulting method declaration are the combined attributes of the defining and the implementing partial method declaration in unspecified order. Duplicates are not removed.
- The attributes on the parameters of the resulting method declaration are the combined attributes of the corresponding parameters of the defining and the implementing partial method declaration in unspecified order. Duplicates are not removed.

If a defining declaration but not an implementing declaration is given for a partial method `M`, the following restrictions apply:

- It is a compile-time error to create a delegate from `M` (§12.7.11.6).
- It is a compile-time error to refer to `M` inside an anonymous function that is converted to an expression tree type (§9.6).
- Expressions occurring as part of an invocation of M do not affect the definite assignment state (§10.4), which can potentially lead to compile-time errors.
- `M` cannot be the entry point for an application (§8.1).

Partial methods are useful for allowing one part of a type declaration to customize the behavior of another part, e.g., one that is generated by a tool. Consider the following partial class declaration:

```csharp
partial class Customer
{
    string name;

    public string Name
    {

        get { return name; }

        set
        {
            OnNameChanging (value);
            name = value;
            OnNameChanged ();
        }

    }

    partial void OnNameChanging (string newName);

    partial void OnNameChanged ();
}
```

If this class is compiled without any other parts, the defining partial method declarations and their invocations will be removed, and the resulting combined class declaration will be equivalent to the following:

```csharp
class Customer
{
    string name;

    public string Name
    {

        get { return name; }

        set { name = value; }
    }
}
```

Assume that another part is given, however, which provides implementing declarations of the partial methods:

```csharp
partial class Customer
{
    partial void OnNameChanging (string newName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine (“Changing“ + name + “to“ + newName);
    }

    partial void OnNameChanged ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine (“Changed to“ + name);
    }
}
```

Then the resulting combined class declaration will be equivalent to the following:

```csharp
class Customer
{
    string name;

    public string Name
    {

        get { return name; }

        set
        {
            OnNameChanging (value);
            name = value;
            OnNameChanged ();
        }

    }

    void OnNameChanging (string newName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine (“Changing“ + name + “to“ + newName);
    }

    void OnNameChanged ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine (“Changed to“ + name);
    }
}
```

### Extension methods

When the first parameter of a method includes the `this` modifier, that method is said to be an ***extension method***. Extension methods shall only be declared in non-generic, non-nested static classes. The first parameter of an extension method may have no modifiers other than `this`, and the parameter type may not be a pointer type.

[*Example*: The following is an example of a static class that declares two extension methods:

```csharp
public static class Extensions
{
    public static int ToInt32 (this string s)
    {
        return Int32.Parse (s);
    }

    public static T[] Slice<T> (this T[] source, int index, int count)
    {
        if (index < 0 || count < 0 || source.Length– index < count)
            throw new ArgumentException ();
        T[] result = new T[count];
        Array.Copy (source, index, result, 0, count);
        return result;
    }
}
```

*end example*]

An extension method is a regular static method. In addition, where its enclosing static class is in scope, an extension method may be invoked using instance method invocation syntax (§12.7.6.3), using the receiver expression as the first argument.

[*Example*: The following program uses the extension methods declared above:

```csharp
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string[] strings = { "1", "22", "333", "4444" };
        foreach (string s in strings.Slice (1, 2))
        {
            Console.WriteLine (s.ToInt32 ());
        }
    }
}
```

The `Slice` method is available on the `string[]`, and the `ToInt32` method is available on `string`, because they have been declared as extension methods. The meaning of the program is the same as the following, using ordinary static method calls:

```csharp
static class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string[] strings = { "1", "22", "333", "4444" };
        foreach (string s in Extensions.Slice (strings, 1, 2))
        {
            Console.WriteLine (Extensions.ToInt32 (s));
        }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Method body

The *method-body* of a method declaration consists of either a *block* or a semicolon.

Abstract and external method declarations do not provide a method implementation, so their method bodies simply consist of a semicolon. For any other method, the method body is a block (§13.3) that contains the statements to execute when that method is invoked.

The ***effective return type*** of a method is `void` if the return type is `void`, or if the method is `async` and the return type is `System.Threading.Tasks.Task`. Otherwise, the effective return type of a non-async method is its return type, and the effective return type of an async method with return type `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<T>` is `T`.

When the effective return type of a method is `void`, return statements (§13.10.5) in that method’s body are not permitted to specify an expression. If execution of the method body of a void method completes normally (that is, control flows off the end of the method body), that method simply returns to its caller.

When the effective return type of a method is not `void`, each return statement in that method's body shall specify an expression that is implicitly convertible to the effective return type. The endpoint of the method body of a value-returning method shall not be reachable. In other words, in a value-returning method, control is not permitted to flow off the end of the method body.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    public int F () { } // Error, return value required

    public int G ()
    {
        return 1;
    }

    public int H (bool b)
    {
        if (b)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

the value-returning `F` method results in a compile-time error because control can flow off the end of the method body. The `G` and `H` methods are correct because all possible execution paths end in a return statement that specifies a return value. *end example*]

## Properties

### General

A ***property*** is a member that provides access to a characteristic of an object or a class. Examples of properties include the length of a string, the size of a font, the caption of a window, the name of a customer, and so on. Properties are a natural extension of fields—both are named members with associated types, and the syntax for accessing fields and properties is the same. However, unlike fields, properties do not denote storage locations. Instead, properties have ***accessors*** that specify the statements to be executed when their values are read or written. Properties thus provide a mechanism for associating actions with the reading and writing of an object’s characteristics; furthermore, they permit such characteristics to be computed.

Properties are declared using *property-declaration*s:

```antlr
property-declaration:
    attributesopt property-modifiersopt type member-name { accessor-declarations }

[property-modifiers:
    property-modifier
    property-modifiers property-modifier

property-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    static
    virtual
    sealed
    override
    abstract
    extern
```

A *property-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22) and a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6), the `new` (§15.3.5), `static` (§15.7.2), `virtual` (§15.6.4, §15.7.6), `override` (§15.6.5, §15.7.6), `sealed` (§15.6.6), `abstract` (§15.6.7, §15.7.6), and `extern` (§15.6.8) modifiers.

Property declarations are subject to the same rules as method declarations (§15.6) with regard to valid combinations of modifiers.

The *type* of a property declaration specifies the type of the property introduced by the declaration, and the *member-name* (§15.6.1) specifies the name of the property. Unless the property is an explicit interface member implementation, the *member-name* is simply an *identifier*. For an explicit interface member implementation (§18.6.2), the *member-name* consists of an *interface-type* followed by a “`.`” and an *identifier*.

The *type* of a property shall be at least as accessible as the property itself (§8.5.5).

The *accessor-declarations*, which shall be enclosed in “`{`” and “`}`” tokens, declare the accessors (§15.7.3) of the property. The accessors specify the executable statements associated with reading and writing the property.

Even though the syntax for accessing a property is the same as that for a field, a property is not classified as a variable. Thus, it is not possible to pass a property as a `ref` or `out` argument.

When a property declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the property is said to be an ***external property***. Because an external property declaration provides no actual implementation, each of its *accessor-declarations* consists of a semicolon.

### Static and instance properties

When a property declaration includes a `static` modifier, the property is said to be a ***static property***. When no `static` modifier is present, the property is said to be an ***instance property***.

A static property is not associated with a specific instance, and it is a compile-time error to refer to this in the accessors of a static property.

An instance property is associated with a given instance of a class, and that instance can be accessed as this (§12.7.8) in the accessors of that property.

The differences between static and instance members are discussed further in §15.3.8.

### Accessors

The *accessor-declarations* of a property specify the executable statements associated with reading and writing that property.

```antlr
accessor-declarations:
    get-accessor-declaration set-accessor-declarationopt
    set-accessor-declaration get-accessor-declarationopt

get-accessor-declaration:
    attributesopt accessor-modifieropt get accessor-body

set-accessor-declaration:
    attributesopt accessor-modifieropt set accessor-body

accessor-modifier:
    protected
    internal
    private
    protected internal
    internal protected

accessor-body:
    block
    ;
```

The accessor declarations consist of a *get-accessor-declaration*, a *set-accessor-declaration*, or both. Each accessor declaration consists of optional attributes, an optional *accessor-modifier*, the token get or set, followed by an *accessor-body*.

The use of *accessor-modifier*s is governed by the following restrictions:

- An *accessor-modifier* shall not be used in an interface or in an explicit interface member implementation.
- For a property or indexer that has no `override` modifier, an *accessor-modifier* is permitted only if the property or indexer has both a `get` and `set` accessor, and then is permitted only on one of those accessors.
- For a property or indexer that includes an `override` modifier, an accessor shall match the *accessor-modifier*, if any, of the accessor being overridden.
- The *accessor-modifier* shall declare an accessibility that is strictly more restrictive than the declared accessibility of the property or indexer itself. To be precise:
  - If the property or indexer has a declared accessibility of `public`, the *accessor-modifier* may be either `protected internal`, `internal`, `protected`, or `private`.
  - If the property or indexer has a declared accessibility of `protected internal`, the *accessor-modifier* may be either `internal`, `protected`, or `private`.
  - If the property or indexer has a declared accessibility of `internal` or `protected`, the *accessor-modifier* shall be `private`.
  - If the property or indexer has a declared accessibility of `private`, no *accessor-modifier* may be used.

For abstract and extern properties, the *accessor-body* for each accessor specified is simply a semicolon. A non-abstract, non-extern property may be an ***automatically implemented property***, in which case both get and set accessors shall be given, both with a semicolon body (§15.7.4). For the accessors of any other non-abstract, non-extern property, the *accessor-body* is a *block* that specifies the statements to be executed when the corresponding accessor is invoked.

A `get` accessor corresponds to a parameterless method with a return value of the property type. Except as the target of an assignment, when a property is referenced in an expression, the `get` accessor of the property is invoked to compute the value of the property (§12.2.2). The body of a `get` accessor shall conform to the rules for value-returning methods described in §15.6.11. In particular, all `return` statements in the body of a `get` accessor shall specify an expression that is implicitly convertible to the property type. Furthermore, the endpoint of a `get` accessor shall not be reachable.

A `set` accessor corresponds to a method with a single value parameter of the property type and a `void` return type. The implicit parameter of a set accessor is always named value. When a property is referenced as the target of an assignment (§12.18), or as the operand of `++` or `–-` (§12.7.10, 12.8.6), the `set` accessor is invoked with an argument that provides the new value (§12.18.2). The body of a `set` accessor shall conform to the rules for void methods described in §15.6.11. In particular, `return` statements in the `set` accessor body are not permitted to specify an expression. Since a `set` accessor implicitly has a parameter named value, it is a compile-time error for a local variable or constant declaration in a `set` accessor to have that name.

Based on the presence or absence of the `get` and `set` accessors, a property is classified as follows:

- A property that includes both a `get` accessor and a `set` accessor is said to be a ***read-write*** property.
- A property that has only a `get` accessor is said to be a ***read-only*** property. It is a compile-time error for a read-only property to be the target of an assignment.
- A property that has only a `set` accessor is said to be a ***write-only*** property. Except as the target of an assignment, it is a compile-time error to reference a write-only property in an expression. [*Note*: The pre- and postfix `++` and `--` operators and compound assignment operators cannot be applied to write-only properties, since these operators read the old value of their operand before they write the new one. *end note*]

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public class Button : Control
{
    private string caption;

    public string Caption
    {
        get
        {
            return caption;
        }
        set
        {
            if (caption != value)
            {
                caption = value;
                Repaint ();
            }
        }
    }

    public override void Paint (Graphics g, Rectangle r)
    {
        // Painting code goes here
    }
}
```

the `Button` control declares a public `Caption` property. The `get` accessor of the `Caption` property returns the `string` stored in the private `caption` field. The `set` accessor checks if the new value is different from the current value, and if so, it stores the new value and repaints the control. Properties often follow the pattern shown above: The `get` accessor simply returns a value stored in a private field, and the `set` accessor modifies that private field and then performs any additional actions required to update fully the state of the object.

Given the `Button` class above, the following is an example of use of the `Caption` property:

```csharp
Button okButton = new Button();
okButton.Caption = "OK"; // Invokes set accessor
string s = okButton.Caption; // Invokes get accessor
```

Here, the `set` accessor is invoked by assigning a value to the property, and the `get` accessor is invoked by referencing the property in an expression. *end example*]

The `get` and `set` accessors of a property are not distinct members, and it is not possible to declare the accessors of a property separately. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
class A
{
    private string name;

    public string Name
    { // Error, duplicate member name
        get { return name; }
    }

    public string Name
    { // Error, duplicate member name
        set { name = value; }
    }
}
```

does not declare a single read-write property. Rather, it declares two properties with the same name, one read-only and one write-only. Since two members declared in the same class cannot have the same name, the example causes a compile-time error to occur. *end example*]

When a derived class declares a property by the same name as an inherited property, the derived property hides the inherited property with respect to both reading and writing. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class A
{
    public int P
    {
        set {…}
    }
}

class B : A
{
    new public int P
    {
        get {…}
    }
}
```

the `P` property in `B` hides the `P` property in `A` with respect to both reading and writing. Thus, in the statements

```csharp
B b = new B();
b.P = 1; // Error, B.P is read-only
((A)b).P = 1; // Ok, reference to A.P
```

the assignment to `b.P` causes a compile-time error to be reported, since the read-only `P` property in `B` hides the write-only `P` property in `A`. Note, however, that a cast can be used to access the hidden `P` property. *end example*]

Unlike public fields, properties provide a separation between an object’s internal state and its public interface. [*Example*: Consider the following code, which uses a `Point` struct to represent a location:

```csharp
class Label
{
    private int x, y;
    private string caption;

    public Label (int x, int y, string caption)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.caption = caption;
    }

    public int X
    {
        get { return x; }
    }

    public int Y
    {
        get { return y; }
    }

    public Point Location
    {
        get { return new Point (x, y); }
    }

    public string Caption
    {
        get { return caption; }
    }
}
```

Here, the `Label` class uses two `int` fields, `x` and `y`, to store its location. The location is publicly exposed both as an `X` and a `Y` property and as a `Location` property of type `Point`. If, in a future version of `Label`, it becomes more convenient to store the location as a `Point` internally, the change can be made without affecting the public interface of the class:

```csharp
class Label
{
    private Point location;
    private string caption;

    public Label (int x, int y, string caption)
    {
        this.location = new Point (x, y);
        this.caption = caption;
    }

    public int X
    {
        get { return location.x; }
    }

    public int Y
    {
        get { return location.y; }
    }

    public Point Location
    {
        get { return location; }
    }

    public string Caption
    {
        get { return caption; }
    }
}
```

Had `x` and `y` instead been public readonly fields, it would have been impossible to make such a change to the `Label` class. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> Exposing state through properties is not necessarily any less efficient than exposing fields directly. In particular, when a property is non-virtual and contains only a small amount of code, the execution environment might replace calls to accessors with the actual code of the accessors. This process is known as ***inlining***, and it makes property access as efficient as field access, yet preserves the increased flexibility of properties.

[*Example*: Since invoking a get accessor is conceptually equivalent to reading the value of a field, it is considered bad programming style for get accessors to have observable side-effects. In the example

```csharp
class Counter
{
    private int next;

    public int Next
    {
        get { return next++; }
    }
}
```

the value of the `Next` property depends on the number of times the property has previously been accessed. Thus, accessing the property produces an observable side effect, and the property should be implemented as a method instead.

The “no side-effects” convention for `get` accessors doesn’t mean that `get` accessors should always be written simply to return values stored in fields. Indeed, `get` accessors often compute the value of a property by accessing multiple fields or invoking methods. However, a properly designed `get` accessor performs no actions that cause observable changes in the state of the object. *end example*]

Properties can be used to delay initialization of a resource until the moment it is first referenced. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System.IO;

public class Console
{
    private static TextReader reader;
    private static TextWriter writer;
    private static TextWriter error;

    public static TextReader In
    {
        get
        {
            if (reader == null)
            {
                reader = new StreamReader (Console.OpenStandardInput ());
            }
            return reader;
        }
    }

    public static TextWriter Out
    {
        get
        {
            if (writer == null)
            {
                writer = new StreamWriter (Console.OpenStandardOutput ());
            }
            return writer;
        }
    }

    public static TextWriter Error
    {
        get
        {
            if (error == null)
            {
                error = new StreamWriter (Console.OpenStandardError ());
            }
            return error;
        }
    }
    …
}
```

The `Console` class contains three properties, `In`, `Out`, and `Error`, that represent the standard input, output, and error devices, respectively. By exposing these members as properties, the `Console` class can delay their initialization until they are actually used. For example, upon first referencing the `Out` property, as in

```csharp
Console.Out.WriteLine("hello, world");
```

the underlying `TextWriter` for the output device is created. However, if the application makes no reference to the `In` and `Error` properties, then no objects are created for those devices. *end example*]

### Automatically implemented properties

When a property is specified as an automatically implemented property, a hidden backing field is automatically available for the property, and the accessors are implemented to read from and write to that backing field. The hidden backing field is inaccessible, it can be read and written only through the automatically implemented property accessors, even within the containing type.

[*Example*:

```csharp
public class Point
{
    public int X { get; set; } // automatically implemented
    public int Y { get; set; } // automatically implemented
}
```

is equivalent to the following declaration:

```csharp
    public class Point
    {
        private int x;
        private int y;
        public int X { get { return x; } set { x = value; } }
        public int Y { get { return y; } set { y = value; } }
    }
```

*end example*]

Because the backing field is inaccessible, automatically implemented read-only or write-only properties do not make sense, and are disallowed. It is however possible to set the access level of each accessor differently. Thus, the effect of a read-only property with a private backing field can be mimicked like this:

```csharp
public class ReadOnlyPoint
{
    public int X { get; private set; }
    public int Y { get; private set; }
    public ReadOnlyPoint (int x, int y) { X = x; Y = y; }
}
```

### Accessibility

If an accessor has an *accessor-modifier*, the accessibility domain (§8.5.3) of the accessor is determined using the declared accessibility of the *accessor-modifier*. If an accessor does not have an *accessor-modifier*, the accessibility domain of the accessor is determined from the declared accessibility of the property or indexer.

The presence of an *accessor-modifier* never affects member lookup (§12.5) or overload resolution (§12.6.4). The modifiers on the property or indexer always determine which property or indexer is bound to, regardless of the context of the access.

Once a particular property or indexer has been selected, the accessibility domains of the specific accessors involved are used to determine if that usage is valid:

- If the usage is as a value (§12.2.2), the get accessor shall exist and be accessible.
- If the usage is as the target of a simple assignment (§12.18.2), the set accessor shall exist and be accessible.
- If the usage is as the target of compound assignment (§12.18.3), or as the target of the `++` or `--` operators (§12.7.10, §12.8.6), both the `get` accessors and the `set` accessor shall exist and be accessible.

[*Example*: In the following example, the property `A.Text` is hidden by the property `B.Text`, even in contexts where only the `set` accessor is called. In contrast, the property `B.Coun`t is not accessible to class `M`, so the accessible property `A.Count` is used instead.

```csharp
class A
{
    public string Text
    {
        get { return "hello"; }
        set { }
    }

    public int Count
    {
        get { return 5; }
        set { }
    }
}

class B : A
{
    private string text = "goodbye";
    private int count = 0;

    new public string Text
    {
        get { return text; }
        protected set { text = value; }
    }

    new protected int Count
    {
        get { return count; }
        set { count = value; }
    }
}

class M
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b = new B ();
        b.Count = 12; // Calls A.Count set accessor
        int i = b.Count; // Calls A.Count get accessor
        b.Text = "howdy"; // Error, B.Text set accessor not accessible
        string s = b.Text; // Calls B.Text get accessor
    }
}
```

*end example*]

An accessor that is used to implement an interface shall not have an *accessor-modifier*. If only one accessor is used to implement an interface, the other accessor may be declared with an *accessor-modifier*: [*Example*:

```csharp
public interface I
{
    string Prop { get; }
}

public class C : I
{
    public Prop
    {
        get { return "April"; } // Must not have a modifier here
        internal set {…} // Ok, because I.Prop has no set accessor
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Virtual, sealed, override, and abstract accessors

A `virtual` property declaration specifies that the accessors of the property are virtual. The `virtual` modifier applies to all non-private accessors of a property. When an accessor of a virtual property has the `private` *accessor-modifier*, the `private` accessor is implicitly not virtual.

An `abstract` property declaration specifies that the accessors of the property are virtual, but does not provide an actual implementation of the accessors. Instead, non-abstract derived classes are required to provide their own implementation for the accessors by overriding the property. Because an accessor for an abstract property declaration provides no actual implementation, its *accessor-body* simply consists of a semicolon. An abstract property shall not have a `private` accessor.

A property declaration that includes both the `abstract` and `override` modifiers specifies that the property is abstract and overrides a base property. The accessors of such a property are also abstract.

Abstract property declarations are only permitted in abstract classes (§15.2.2.2). The accessors of an inherited virtual property can be overridden in a derived class by including a property declaration that specifies an `override` directive. This is known as an ***overriding property declaration***. An overriding property declaration does not declare a `new` property. Instead, it simply specializes the implementations of the accessors of an existing `virtual` property.

An overriding property declaration shall specify the exact same accessibility modifiers and name as the inherited property, and there shall be an identity conversion between the type of the overriding and the inherited property. If the inherited property has only a single accessor (i.e., if the inherited property is read-only or write-only), the overriding property shall include only that accessor. If the inherited property includes both accessors (i.e., if the inherited property is read-write), the overriding property can include either a single accessor or both accessors.

An overriding property declaration may include the `sealed` modifier. Use of this modifier prevents a derived class from further overriding the property. The accessors of a `sealed` property are also sealed.

Except for differences in declaration and invocation syntax, `virtual`, `sealed`, `override`, and `abstract` accessors behave exactly like `virtual`, `sealed`, `override` and `abstract` methods. Specifically, the rules described in §15.6.4, §15.6.5, §15.6.6, and §15.6.7 apply as if accessors were methods of a corresponding form:

- A `get` accessor corresponds to a parameterless method with a return value of the property type and the same modifiers as the containing property.
- A `set` accessor corresponds to a method with a single value parameter of the property type, a `void` return type, and the same modifiers as the containing property.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
abstract class A
{
    int y;

    public virtual int X
    {
        get { return 0; }
    }

    public virtual int Y
    {
        get { return y; }
        set { y = value; }
    }

    public abstract int Z { get; set; }
}
```

`X` is a virtual read-only property, `Y` is a virtual read-write property, and `Z` is an abstract read-write property. Because `Z` is abstract, the containing class `A` shall also be declared abstract.

A class that derives from `A` is show below:

```csharp
class B : A
{
    int z;

    public override int X
    {
        get { return base.X + 1; }
    }

    public override int Y
    {
        set { base.Y = value < 0 ? 0 : value; }
    }

    public override int Z
    {
        get { return z; }
        set { z = value; }
    }
}
```

Here, the declarations of `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are overriding property declarations. Each property declaration exactly matches the accessibility modifiers, type, and name of the corresponding inherited property. The `get` accessor of `X` and the `set` accessor of `Y` use the `base` keyword to access the inherited accessors. The declaration of `Z` overrides both abstract accessors—thus, there are no outstanding abstract function members in `B`, and `B` is permitted to be a non-abstract class. *end example*]

When a property is declared as an override, any overridden accessors shall be accessible to the overriding code. In addition, the declared accessibility of both the property or indexer itself, and of the accessors, shall match that of the overridden member and accessors. [*Example*:

```csharp
public class B
{
    public virtual int P
    {
        protected set {…}
        get {…}
    }
}

public class D : B
{
    public override int P
    {
        protected set {…} // Must specify protected here
        get {…} // Must not have a modifier here
    }
}
```

*end example*]

## Events

### General

An ***event*** is a member that enables an object or class to provide notifications. Clients can attach executable code for events by supplying ***event handlers***.

Events are declared using *event-declaration*s:

```antlr
event-declaration:
    attributesopt event-modifiersopt event type variable-declarators ;
    attributesopt event-modifiersopt event type member-name
    { event-accessor-declarations }

vent-modifiers:
    event-modifier
    event-modifiers event-modifier

event-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    static
    virtual
    sealed
    override
    abstract
    extern

event-accessor-declarations:
    add-accessor-declaration remove-accessor-declaration
    remove-accessor-declaration add-accessor-declaration

add-accessor-declaration:
    attributesopt add block

remove-accessor-declaration:
    attributesopt remove block
```

An *event-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22) and a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6), the `new` (§15.3.5), `static` (§15.6.3, §15.8.4), `virtual` (§15.6.4, §15.8.5), `override` (§15.6.5, §15.8.5), `sealed` (§15.6.6), `abstract` (§15.6.7, §15.8.5), and `extern` (§15.6.8) modifiers.

Event declarations are subject to the same rules as method declarations (§15.6) with regard to valid combinations of modifiers.

The *type* of an event declaration shall be a *delegate-type* (§9.2.8), and that *delegate-type* shall be at least as accessible as the event itself (§8.5.5).

An event declaration can include *event-accessor-declaration*s. However, if it does not, for non-extern, non-abstract events, the compiler shall supply them automatically (§15.8.2); for extern events, the accessors are provided externally.

An event declaration that omits *event-accessor-declaration*s defines one or more events—one for each of the *variable-declarator*s. The attributes and modifiers apply to all of the members declared by such an *event-declaration*.

It is a compile-time error for an *event-declaration* to include both the `abstract` modifier and *event-accessor-declaration*s.

When an event declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the event is said to be an ***external event***. Because an external event declaration provides no actual implementation, it is an error for it to include both the `extern` modifier and *event-accessor-declaration*s.

It is a compile-time error for a *variable-declarator* of an event declaration with an `abstract` or `external` modifier to include a *variable-initializer*.

An event can be used as the left-hand operand of the `+=` and `-=` operators. These operators are used, respectively, to attach event handlers to, or to remove event handlers from an event, and the access modifiers of the event control the contexts in which such operations are permitted.

The only operations that are permitted on an event by code that is outside the type in which that event is declared, are `+=` and `-=`. Therefore, while such code can add and remove handlers for an event, it cannot directly obtain or modify the underlying list of event handlers.

In an operation of the form `x += y` or `x –= y`, when `x` is an event the result of the operation has type `void` (§12.18.4) (as opposed to having the type of `x`, with the value of `x` after the assignment, as for other the `+=` and `-=` operators defined on non-event types). This prevents external code from indirectly examining the underlying delegate of an event.

[*Example*: The following example shows how event handlers are attached to instances of the `Button` class:

```csharp
public delegate void EventHandler (object sender, EventArgs e);

public class Button : Control
{
    public event EventHandler Click;
}

public class LoginDialog : Form
{
    Button okButton;
    Button cancelButton;

    public LoginDialog ()
    {
        okButton = new Button (…);
        okButton.Click += new EventHandler (OkButtonClick);
        cancelButton = new Button (…);
        cancelButton.Click += new EventHandler (CancelButtonClick);
    }

    void OkButtonClick (object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle okButton.Click event
    }

    void CancelButtonClick (object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle cancelButton.Click event
    }
}
```

Here, the `LoginDialog` instance constructor creates two Button instances and attaches event handlers to the `Click` events. *end example*]

### Field-like events

Within the program text of the class or struct that contains the declaration of an event, certain events can be used like fields. To be used in this way, an event shall not be `abstract` or `extern`, and shall not explicitly include *event-accessor-declaration*s. Such an event can be used in any context that permits a field. The field contains a delegate (§20), which refers to the list of event handlers that have been added to the event. If no event handlers have been added, the field contains `null`.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public delegate void EventHandler (object sender, EventArgs e);

public class Button : Control
{
    public event EventHandler Click;

    protected void OnClick (EventArgs e)
    {
        EventHandler handler = Click;
        if (handler != null)
            handler (this, e);
    }

    public void Reset ()
    {
        Click = null;
    }
}
```

`Click` is used as a field within the `Button` class. As the example demonstrates, the field can be examined, modified, and used in delegate invocation expressions. The `OnClick` method in the `Button` class “raises” the `Click` event. The notion of raising an event is precisely equivalent to invoking the delegate represented by the event—thus, there are no special language constructs for raising events. Note that the delegate invocation is preceded by a check that ensures the delegate is non-null and that the check is made on a local copy to ensure thread safety.

Outside the declaration of the `Button` class, the `Click` member can only be used on the left-hand side of the `+=` and `–=` operators, as in

```csharp
b.Click += new EventHandler(…);
```

which appends a delegate to the invocation list of the `Click` event, and

```csharp
b.Click –= new EventHandler(…);
```

which removes a delegate from the invocation list of the `Click` event. *end example*]

When compiling a field-like event, the compiler automatically creates storage to hold the delegate, and creates accessors for the event that add or remove event handlers to the delegate field. The addition and removal operations are thread safe, and may (but are not required to) be done while holding the lock (§10.4.4.19) on the containing object for an instance event, or the type object (§12.7.11.7) for a static event.

> [!NOTE]
> Thus, an instance event declaration of the form:
> 
> ```csharp
> class X
> {
>     public event D Ev;
> }
> 
> shall be compiled to something equivalent to:
> 
>     class X
>     {
>         private D __Ev; // field to hold the delegate
> 
>         public event D Ev
>         {
>             add
>             {
>                 /* add the delegate in a thread safe way */
>             }
> 
>             remove
>             {
>                 /* remove the delegate in a thread safe way */
>             }
>         }
>     }
> ```
> 
> Within the class `X`, references to `Ev` on the left-hand side of the `+=` and `–=` operators cause the add and remove accessors to be invoked. All other references to `Ev` are compiled to reference the hidden field `__Ev` instead (§12.7.5). The name “`__Ev`” is arbitrary; the hidden field could have any name or no name at all. 

###  Event accessors

> [!NOTE]
> Event declarations typically omit *event-accessor-declaration*s, as in the Button example above. For example, they might be included if the storage cost of one field per event is not acceptable. In such cases, a class can include *event-accessor-declaration*s and use a private mechanism for storing the list of event handlers.

The *event-accessor-declarations* of an event specify the executable statements associated with adding and removing event handlers.

The accessor declarations consist of an *add-accessor-declaration* and a *remove-accessor-declaration*. Each accessor declaration consists of the token add or remove followed by a *block*. The *block* associated with an *add-accessor-declaration* specifies the statements to execute when an event handler is added, and the *block* associated with a *remove-accessor-declaration* specifies the statements to execute when an event handler is removed.

Each *add-accessor-declaration* and *remove-accessor-declaration* corresponds to a method with a single value parameter of the event type, and a void return type. The implicit parameter of an event accessor is named value. When an event is used in an event assignment, the appropriate event accessor is used. Specifically, if the assignment operator is `+=` then the add accessor is used, and if the assignment operator is `–=` then the remove accessor is used. In either case, the right-hand operand of the assignment operator is used as the argument to the event accessor. The block of an *add-accessor-declaration* or a *remove-accessor-declaration* shall conform to the rules for void methods described in §15.6.9. In particular, return statements in such a block are not permitted to specify an expression.

Since an event accessor implicitly has a parameter named value, it is a compile-time error for a local variable or constant declared in an event accessor to have that name.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Control : Component
{
    // Unique keys for events
    static readonly object mouseDownEventKey = new object ();
    static readonly object mouseUpEventKey = new object ();

    // Return event handler associated with key
    protected Delegate GetEventHandler (object key) {…}

    // Add event handler associated with key
    protected void AddEventHandler (object key, Delegate handler) {…}

    // Remove event handler associated with key
    protected void RemoveEventHandler (object key, Delegate handler) {…}

    // MouseDown event
    public event MouseEventHandler MouseDown
    {
        add { AddEventHandler (mouseDownEventKey, value); }
        remove { RemoveEventHandler (mouseDownEventKey, value); }
    }

    // MouseUp event
    public event MouseEventHandler MouseUp
    {
        add { AddEventHandler (mouseUpEventKey, value); }
        remove { RemoveEventHandler (mouseUpEventKey, value); }
    }

    // Invoke the MouseUp event
    protected void OnMouseUp (MouseEventArgs args)
    {
        MouseEventHandler handler;
        handler = (MouseEventHandler) GetEventHandler (mouseUpEventKey);
        if (handler != null)
            handler (this, args);
    }
}
```

the `Control` class implements an internal storage mechanism for events. The `AddEventHandler` method associates a delegate value with a key, the `GetEventHandler` method returns the delegate currently associated with a key, and the `RemoveEventHandler` method removes a delegate as an event handler for the specified event. Presumably, the underlying storage mechanism is designed such that there is no cost for associating a null delegate value with a key, and thus unhandled events consume no storage. *end example*]

### Static and instance events

When an event declaration includes a `static` modifier, the event is said to be a ***static event***. When no `static` modifier is present, the event is said to be an ***instance event***.

A static event is not associated with a specific instance, and it is a compile-time error to refer to this in the accessors of a static event.

An instance event is associated with a given instance of a class, and this instance can be accessed as this (§12.7.8) in the accessors of that event.

The differences between static and instance members are discussed further in §15.3.8.

### Virtual, sealed, override, and abstract accessors

A `virtual` event declaration specifies that the accessors of that event are virtual. The `virtual` modifier applies to both accessors of an event.

An `abstract` event declaration specifies that the accessors of the event are `virtual`, but does not provide an actual implementation of the accessors. Instead, non-abstract derived classes are required to provide their own implementation for the accessors by overriding the event. Because an accessor for an `abstract` event declaration provides no actual implementation, it shall not provide *event-accessor-declaration*s.

An event declaration that includes both the `abstract` and `override` modifiers specifies that the event is abstract and overrides a base event. The accessors of such an event are also abstract.

Abstract event declarations are only permitted in abstract classes (§15.2.2.2).

The accessors of an inherited virtual event can be overridden in a derived class by including an event declaration that specifies an `override` modifier. This is known as an ***overriding event declaration***. An overriding event declaration does not declare a new event. Instead, it simply specializes the implementations of the accessors of an existing virtual event.

An overriding event declaration shall specify the exact same accessibility modifiers and name as the overridden event, there shall be an identity conversion between the type of the overriding and the overridden event, and both the add and remove accessors shall be specified within the declaration.

An overriding event declaration can include the `sealed` modifier. Use of this modifier prevents a derived class from further overriding the event. The accessors of a sealed event are also sealed.

It is a compile-time error for an overriding event declaration to include a `new` modifier.

Except for differences in declaration and invocation syntax, `virtual`, `sealed`, `override`, and `abstract` accessors behave exactly like `virtual`, `sealed`, `override` and `abstract` methods. Specifically, the rules described in §15.6.4, §15.6.5, §15.6.6, and §15.6.7 apply as if accessors were methods of a corresponding form. Each accessor corresponds to a method with a single value parameter of the event type, a `void` return type, and the same modifiers as the containing event.

## Indexers

An ***indexer*** is a member that enables an object to be indexed in the same way as an array. Indexers are declared using *indexer-declaration*s:

```antlr
indexer-declaration:
    attributesopt indexer-modifiersopt indexer-declarator { accessor-declarations }

indexer-modifiers:
    indexer-modifier
    indexer-modifiers indexer-modifier

indexer-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    virtual
    sealed
    override
    abstract
    extern

indexer-declarator:
    type this [ formal-parameter-list ]
    type interface-type . this [ formal-parameter-list ]
```

An *indexer-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22) and a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6), the `new` (§15.3.5), `virtual` (§15.6.4), `override` (§15.6.5), `sealed` (§15.6.6), `abstract` (§15.6.7), and `extern` (§15.6.8) modifiers.

Indexer declarations are subject to the same rules as method declarations (§15.6) with regard to valid combinations of modifiers, with the one exception being that the `static` modifier is not permitted on an indexer declaration.

The modifiers `virtual`, `override`, and `abstract` are mutually exclusive except in one case. The `abstract` and `override` modifiers may be used together so that an abstract indexer can override a virtual one.

The *type* of an indexer declaration specifies the element type of the indexer introduced by the declaration. Unless the indexer is an explicit interface member implementation, the *type* is followed by the keyword `this`. For an explicit interface member implementation, the *type* is followed by an *interface-type*, a “`.`”, and the keyword this. Unlike other members, indexers do not have user-defined names.

The *formal-parameter-list* specifies the parameters of the indexer. The formal parameter list of an indexer corresponds to that of a method (§15.6.2), except that at least one parameter shall be specified, and that the `this`, `ref`, and `out` parameter modifiers are not permitted.

The *type* of an indexer and each of the types referenced in the *formal-parameter-list* shall be at least as accessible as the indexer itself (§8.5.5).

The *accessor-declarations* (§15.7.3), which shall be enclosed in “`{`” and “`}`” tokens, declare the accessors of the indexer. The accessors specify the executable statements associated with reading and writing indexer elements.

Even though the syntax for accessing an indexer element is the same as that for an array element, an indexer element is not classified as a variable. Thus, it is not possible to pass an indexer element as a `ref` or `out` argument.

The *formal-parameter-list* of an indexer defines the signature (§8.6) of the indexer. Specifically, the signature of an indexer consists of the number and types of its formal parameters. The element type and names of the formal parameters are not part of an indexer’s signature.

The signature of an indexer shall differ from the signatures of all other indexers declared in the same class.

Indexers and properties are very similar in concept, but differ in the following ways:

- A property is identified by its name, whereas an indexer is identified by its signature.
- A property is accessed through a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) or a *member-access* (§12.7.5), whereas an indexer element is accessed through an *element-access* (§12.7.7.3).
- A property can be a `static` member, whereas an indexer is always an instance member.
- A `get` accessor of a property corresponds to a method with no parameters, whereas a get accessor of an indexer corresponds to a method with the same formal parameter list as the indexer.
- A `set` accessor of a property corresponds to a method with a single parameter named value, whereas a `set` accessor of an indexer corresponds to a method with the same formal parameter list as the indexer, plus an additional parameter named value.
- It is a compile-time error for an indexer accessor to declare a local variable or local constant with the same name as an indexer parameter.
- In an overriding property declaration, the inherited property is accessed using the syntax `base.P`, where `P` is the property name. In an overriding indexer declaration, the inherited indexer is accessed using the syntax `base[E]`, where `E` is a comma-separated list of expressions.

Aside from these differences, all rules defined in §15.7.3 and §15.7.6 apply to indexer accessors as well as to property accessors.

When an indexer declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the indexer is said to be an ***external indexer***. Because an external indexer declaration provides no actual implementation, each of its *accessor-declarations* consists of a semicolon.

[*Example*: The example below declares a BitArray class that implements an indexer for accessing the individual bits in the bit array.

```csharp
using System;

class BitArray
{
    int[] bits;
    int length;

    public BitArray (int length)
    {
        if (length < 0) throw new ArgumentException ();
        bits = new int[((length - 1) >> 5) + 1];
        this.length = length;
    }

    public int Length
    {
        get { return length; }
    }

    public bool this [int index]
    {
        get
        {
            if (index < 0 || index >= length)
            {
                throw new IndexOutOfRangeException ();
            }
            return (bits[index >> 5] & 1 << index) != 0;
        }
        set
        {
            if (index < 0 || index >= length)
            {
                throw new IndexOutOfRangeException ();
            }
            if (value)
            {
                bits[index >> 5] |= 1 << index;
            }
            else
            {
                bits[index >> 5] &= ~(1 << index);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

An instance of the `BitArray` class consumes substantially less memory than a corresponding `bool[]` (since each value of the former occupies only one bit instead of the latter’s one byte), but it permits the same operations as a `bool[]`.

The following `CountPrimes` class uses a `BitArray` and the classical “sieve” algorithm to compute the number of primes between 2 and a given maximum:

```csharp
class CountPrimes
{
    static int Count (int max)
    {
        BitArray flags = new BitArray (max + 1);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= max; i++)
        {
            if (!flags[i])
            {
                for (int j = i * 2; j <= max; j += i) flags[j] = true;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        int max = int.Parse (args[0]);
        int count = Count (max);
        Console.WriteLine (
            "Found {0} primes between 2 and {1}", count, max);
    }
}
```

Note that the syntax for accessing elements of the BitArray is precisely the same as for a `bool[]`. *end example*]

[*Example*: The following example shows a 26×10 grid class that has an indexer with two parameters. The first parameter is required to be an upper- or lowercase letter in the range A–Z, and the second is required to be an integer in the range 0–9.

```csharp
using System;

class Grid
{
    const int NumRows = 26;
    const int NumCols = 10;
    int[, ] cells = new int[NumRows, NumCols];

    public int this [char row, int col]
    {
        get
        {
            row = Char.ToUpper (row);
            if (row < 'A' || row > 'Z')
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException ("row");
            }
            if (col < 0 || col >= NumCols)
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException ("col");
            }
            return cells[row - 'A', col];
        }

        set
        {
            row = Char.ToUpper (row);
            if (row < 'A' || row > 'Z')
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException ("row");
            }
            if (col < 0 || col >= NumCols)
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException ("col");
            }
            cells[row - 'A', col] = value;
        }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

## Operators

### General

An ***operator*** is a member that defines the meaning of an expression operator that can be applied to instances of the class. Operators are declared using *operator-declaration*s:

```antlr
operator-declaration:
    attributesopt operator-modifiers operator-declarator operator-body

operator-modifiers:
    operator-modifier
    operator-modifiers operator-modifier

operator-modifier:
    public
    static
    extern

operator-declarator:
    unary-operator-declarator
    binary-operator-declarator
    conversion-operator-declarator

unary-operator-declarator:
    type operator overloadable-unary-operator ( fixed-parameter )

overloadable-unary-operator: one of
    + - ! ~ ++ -- true false

binary-operator-declarator:
    type operator overloadable-binary-operator ( fixed-parameter , fixed-parameter )

overloadable-binary-operator: one of
    + - * / % & | \^ << right-shift
    == != > < >= <=

conversion-operator-declarator:
    implicit operator type ( fixed-parameter )
    explicit operator type ( fixed-parameter )

operator-body:
    block
    ;
```

There are three categories of overloadable operators: Unary operators (§15.10.2), binary operators (§15.10.3), and conversion operators (§15.10.4).

When an operator declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the operator is said to be an ***external operator***. Because an external operator provides no actual implementation, its *operator-body* consists of a semi-colon. For all other operators, the *operator-body* consists of a *block*, which specifies the statements to execute when the operator is invoked. The *block* of an operator shall conform to the rules for value-returning methods described in §15.6.11.

The following rules apply to all operator declarations:

- An operator declaration shall include both a `public` and a `static` modifier.
- The parameter(s) of an operator shall have no modifiers.
- The signature of an operator (§15.10.2, §15.10.3, §15.10.4) shall differ from the signatures of all other operators declared in the same class.
- All types referenced in an operator declaration shall be at least as accessible as the operator itself (§8.5.5).
- It is an error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in an operator declaration.

Each operator category imposes additional restrictions, as described in the following subclauses.

Like other members, operators declared in a base class are inherited by derived classes. Because operator declarations always require the class or struct in which the operator is declared to participate in the signature of the operator, it is not possible for an operator declared in a derived class to hide an operator declared in a base class. Thus, the `new` modifier is never required, and therefore never permitted, in an operator declaration.

Additional information on unary and binary operators can be found in §12.4.

Additional information on conversion operators can be found in §11.5.

### Unary operators

The following rules apply to unary operator declarations, where T denotes the instance type of the class or struct that contains the operator declaration:

- A unary `+`, `-`, `!`, or `~` operator shall take a single parameter of type `T` or `T?` and can return any type.
- A unary `++ `or `--` operator shall take a single parameter of type `T` or `T?` and shall return that same type or a type derived from it.
- A unary `true` or `false` operator shall take a single parameter of type `T` or `T?` and shall return type `bool`.

The signature of a unary operator consists of the operator token (`+`, `-`, `!`, `~`, `++`, `--`, `true`, or `false`) and the type of the single formal parameter. The return type is not part of a unary operator’s signature, nor is the name of the formal parameter.

The `true` and `false` unary operators require pair-wise declaration. A compile-time error occurs if a class declares one of these operators without also declaring the other. The `true` and `false` operators are described further in §12.21.

[*Example*: The following example shows an implementation and subsequent usage of `operator++` for an integer vector class:

```csharp
public class IntVector
{
    public IntVector (int length) {…}

    public int Length {…} // read-only property
    public int this [int index] {…} // read-write indexer

    public static IntVector operator ++ (IntVector iv)
    {
        IntVector temp = new IntVector (iv.Length);
        for (int i = 0; i < iv.Length; i++)
            temp[i] = iv[i] + 1;
        return temp;
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        IntVector iv1 = new IntVector (4); // vector of 4 x 0
        IntVector iv2;

        iv2 = iv1++; // iv2 contains 4 x 0, iv1 contains 4 x 1
        iv2 = ++iv1; // iv2 contains 4 x 2, iv1 contains 4 x 2
    }
}
```

Note how the operator method returns the value produced by adding 1 to the operand, just like the postfix increment and decrement operators (§12.7.10), and the prefix increment and decrement operators (§12.8.6). Unlike in C++, this method should not modify the value of its operand directly as this would violate the standard semantics of the postfix increment operator (§12.8.6). *end example*]

### Binary operators

The following rules apply to binary operator declarations, where `T` denotes the instance type of the class or struct that contains the operator declaration:

- A binary non-shift operator shall take two parameters, at least one of which shall have type `T` or `T?`, and can return any type.
- A binary `<<` or `>>` operator (§12.10) shall take two parameters, the first of which shall have type `T` or `T?` and the second of which shall have type `int` or `int?`, and can return any type.

The signature of a binary operator consists of the operator token (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`,`~`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, or `<=`) and the types of the two formal parameters. The return type and the names of the formal parameters are not part of a binary operator’s signature.

Certain binary operators require pair-wise declaration. For every declaration of either operator of a pair, there shall be a matching declaration of the other operator of the pair. Two operator declarations match if identity conversions exist between their return types and their corresponding parameter types. The following operators require pair-wise declaration:

- operator `==` and operator `!=`
- operator `>` and operator `<`
- operator `>=` and operator `<=`

### Conversion operators

A conversion operator declaration introduces a ***user-defined conversion*** (§11.5), which augments the pre-defined implicit and explicit conversions.

A conversion operator declaration that includes the implicit keyword introduces a user-defined implicit conversion. Implicit conversions can occur in a variety of situations, including function member invocations, cast expressions, and assignments. This is described further in §11.2.

A conversion operator declaration that includes the `explicit` keyword introduces a user-defined explicit conversion. Explicit conversions can occur in cast expressions, and are described further in §11.3.

A conversion operator converts from a source type, indicated by the parameter type of the conversion operator, to a target type, indicated by the return type of the conversion operator.

For a given source type `S` and target type `T`, if `S` or `T` are nullable value types, let `S0` and `T0` refer to their underlying types; otherwise, `S0` and `T0` are equal to `S` and `T` respectively. A class or struct is permitted to declare a conversion from a source type `S` to a target type `T` only if all of the following are true:

- `S0` and `T0` are different types.
- Either `S0` or `T0` is the instance type of the class or struct that contains the operator declaration.
- Neither `S0` nor `T0` is an *interface-type*.
- Excluding user-defined conversions, a conversion does not exist from `S` to `T` or from `T` to `S`.

For the purposes of these rules, any type parameters associated with `S` or `T` are considered to be unique types that have no inheritance relationship with other types, and any constraints on those type parameters are ignored.

[*Example*: In the following:

```csharp
class C<T> {…}

class D<T> : C<T>
{
    public static implicit operator C<int> (D<T> value) {…} // Ok

    public static implicit operator C<string> (D<T> value) {…} // Ok

    public static implicit operator C<T> (D<T> value) {…} // Error
}
```

the first two operator declarations are permitted because `T` and `int` and `string`, respectively are considered unique types with no relationship. However, the third operator is an error because `C<T>` is the base class of `D<T>`. *end example*]

From the second rule, it follows that a conversion operator shall convert either to or from the class or struct type in which the operator is declared. [*Example*: It is possible for a class or struct type `C` to define a conversion from `C` to `int` and from `int` to `C`, but not from `int` to `bool`. *end example*]

It is not possible to directly redefine a pre-defined conversion. Thus, conversion operators are not allowed to convert from or to object because implicit and explicit conversions already exist between object and all other types. Likewise, neither the source nor the target types of a conversion can be a base type of the other, since a conversion would then already exist. However, it *is* possible to declare operators on generic types that, for particular type arguments, specify conversions that already exist as pre-defined conversions. [*Example*:

```csharp
struct Convertible<T>
{
    public static implicit operator Convertible<T> (T value) {…}

    public static explicit operator T (Convertible<T> value) {…}
}
```

when type `object` is specified as a type argument for `T`, the second operator declares a conversion that already exists (an implicit, and therefore also an explicit, conversion exists from any type to type object). *end example*]

In cases where a pre-defined conversion exists between two types, any user-defined conversions between those types are ignored. Specifically:

- If a pre-defined implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from type `S` to type `T`, all user-defined conversions (implicit or explicit) from `S` to `T` are ignored.
- If a pre-defined explicit conversion (§11.3) exists from type `S` to type `T`, any user-defined explicit conversions from `S` to `T` are ignored. Furthermore:
  - If either `S` or `T` is an interface type, user-defined implicit conversions from `S` to `T` are ignored.
  - Otherwise, user-defined implicit conversions from `S` to `T` are still considered.

For all types but `object`, the operators declared by the `Convertible<T>` type above do not conflict with pre-defined conversions. [*Example*:

```csharp
void F (int i, Convertible<int> n)
{
    i = n; // Error
    i = (int) n; // User-defined explicit conversion
    n = i; // User-defined implicit conversion
    n = (Convertible<int>) i; // User-defined implicit conversion
}

However,
for type object, pre - defined conversions hide the user - defined conversions in all cases but one:

    void F (object o, Convertible<object> n)
    {
        o = n; // Pre-defined boxing conversion
        o = (object) n; // Pre-defined boxing conversion
        n = o; // User-defined implicit conversion
        n = (Convertible<object>) o; // Pre-defined unboxing conversion
    }
```

*end example*]

User-defined conversions are not allowed to convert from or to *interface-type*s. In particular, this restriction ensures that no user-defined transformations occur when converting to an *interface-type*, and that a conversion to an *interface-type* succeeds only if the object being converted actually implements the specified *interface-type*.

The signature of a conversion operator consists of the source type and the target type. (This is the only form of member for which the return type participates in the signature.) The implicit or explicit classification of a conversion operator is not part of the operator’s signature. Thus, a class or struct cannot declare both an implicit and an explicit conversion operator with the same source and target types.

[*Note*: In general, user-defined implicit conversions should be designed to never throw exceptions and never lose information. If a user-defined conversion can give rise to exceptions (for example, because the source argument is out of range) or loss of information (such as discarding high-order bits), then that conversion should be defined as an explicit conversion. *end note*]

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

public struct Digit
{
    byte value;

    public Digit (byte value)
    {
        if (value < 0 || value > 9) throw new ArgumentException ();
        this.value = value;
    }

    public static implicit operator byte (Digit d)
    {
        return d.value;
    }

    public static explicit operator Digit (byte b)
    {
        return new Digit (b);
    }
}
```

the conversion from `Digit` to `byte` is implicit because it never throws exceptions or loses information, but the conversion from `byte` to `Digit` is explicit since `Digit` can only represent a subset of the possible values of a `byte`. *end example*]

## Instance constructors

### General

An ***instance constructor*** is a member that implements the actions required to initialize an instance of a class. Instance constructors are declared using *constructor-declaration*s:

```antlr
constructor-declaration:
    attributesopt constructor-modifiersopt constructor-declarator constructor-body

constructor-modifiers:
    constructor-modifier
    constructor-modifiers constructor-modifier

constructor-modifier:
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    extern

constructor-declarator:
    identifier ( formal-parameter-listopt ) constructor-initializeropt

constructor-initializer:
    : base ( argument-listopt )
    : this ( argument-listopt )

constructor-body:
    block
    ;
```

A *constructor-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22), a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6), and an `extern` (§15.6.8) modifier. A constructor declaration is not permitted to include the same modifier multiple times.

The *identifier* of a *constructor-declarator* shall name the class in which the instance constructor is declared. If any other name is specified, a compile-time error occurs.

The optional *formal-parameter-list* of an instance constructor is subject to the same rules as the *formal-parameter-list* of a method (§15.6). As the `this` modifier for parameters only applies to extension methods (§15.6.10), no parameter in a constructor's *formal-parameter-list* shall contain the `this` modifier. The formal parameter list defines the signature (§8.6) of an instance constructor and governs the process whereby overload resolution (§12.6.4) selects a particular instance constructor in an invocation.

Each of the types referenced in the *formal-parameter-list* of an instance constructor shall be at least as accessible as the constructor itself (§8.5.5).

The optional *constructor-initializer* specifies another instance constructor to invoke before executing the statements given in the *constructor-body* of `this` instance constructor. This is described further in §15.11.2.

When a constructor declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the constructor is said to be an ***external constructor***. Because an external constructor declaration provides no actual implementation, its *constructor-body* consists of a semicolon. For all other constructors, the *constructor-body* consists of a *block*, which specifies the statements to initialize a new instance of the class. This corresponds exactly to the *block* of an instance method with a `void` return type (§15.6.11).

Instance constructors are not inherited. Thus, a class has no instance constructors other than those actually declared in the class, with the exception that if a class contains no instance constructor declarations, a default instance constructor is automatically provided (§15.11.5).

Instance constructors are invoked by *object-creation-expression*s (§12.7.11.2) and through *constructor-initializer*s.

### Constructor initializers

All instance constructors (except those for class `object`) implicitly include an invocation of another instance constructor immediately before the *constructor-body*. The constructor to implicitly invoke is determined by the *constructor-initializer*:

- An instance constructor initializer of the form `base(*argument-listopt*)` causes an instance constructor from the direct base class to be invoked. That constructor is selected using *argument-list* and the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. The set of candidate instance constructors consists of all the accessible instance constructors of the direct base class. If this set is empty, or if a single best instance constructor cannot be identified, a compile-time error occurs.
- An instance constructor initializer of the form `this(*argument-listopt*)` invokes another instance constructor from the same class. The constructor is selected using *argument-list* and the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. The set of candidate instance constructors consists of all instance constructors declared in the class itself. If the resulting set of applicable instance constructors is empty, or if a single best instance constructor cannot be identified, a compile-time error occurs. If an instance constructor declaration invokes itself through a chain of one or more constructor initializers, a compile-time error occurs.

If an instance constructor has no constructor initializer, a constructor initializer of the form base()is implicitly provided. 

> [!NOTE]
> Thus, an instance constructor declaration of the form
> 
> ```csharp
> C(…) {…}
> ```
> is exactly equivalent to
> 
> ```csharp
> C(…): base() {…}
> ```

The scope of the parameters given by the *formal-parameter-list* of an instance constructor declaration includes the constructor initializer of that declaration. Thus, a constructor initializer is permitted to access the parameters of the constructor. [*Example*:

```csharp
class A
{
    public A (int x, int y) { }
}

class B : A
{
    public B (int x, int y) : base (x + y, x - y) { }
}
```

*end example*]

An instance constructor initializer cannot access the instance being created. Therefore it is a compile-time error to reference this in an argument expression of the constructor initializer, as it is a compile-time error for an argument expression to reference any instance member through a *simple-name*.

### Instance variable initializers

When an instance constructor has no constructor initializer, or it has a constructor initializer of the form `base(…)`, that constructor implicitly performs the initializations specified by the *variable-initializer*s of the instance fields declared in its class. This corresponds to a sequence of assignments that are executed immediately upon entry to the constructor and before the implicit invocation of the direct base class constructor. The variable initializers are executed in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration (§15.5.6).

### Constructor execution

Variable initializers are transformed into assignment statements, and these assignment statements are executed *before* the invocation of the base class instance constructor. This ordering ensures that all instance fields are initialized by their variable initializers before *any* statements that have access to that instance are executed. [*Example*: Given the following:

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    public A ()
    {
        PrintFields ();
    }

    public virtual void PrintFields () { }
}

class B : A
{
    int x = 1;
    int y;

    public B ()
    {
        y = -1;
    }

    public override void PrintFields ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("x = {0}, y = {1}", x, y);
    }
}
```

when `new B()` is used to create an instance of `B`, the following output is produced:

```csharp
x = 1, y = 0
```

The value of `x` is 1 because the variable initializer is executed before the base class instance constructor is invoked. However, the value of `y` is 0 (the default value of an `int`) because the assignment to `y` is not executed until after the base class constructor returns.

It is useful to think of instance variable initializers and constructor initializers as statements that are automatically inserted before the *constructor-body*. The example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;

class A
{
    int x = 1, y = -1, count;

    public A ()
    {
        count = 0;
    }

    public A (int n)
    {
        count = n;
    }
}

class B : A
{
    double sqrt2 = Math.Sqrt (2.0);
    ArrayList items = new ArrayList (100);
    int max;

    public B () : this (100)
    {
        items.Add ("default");
    }

    public B (int n) : base (n– 1)
    {
        max = n;
    }
}
```

contains several variable initializers; it also contains constructor initializers of both forms (`base` and `this`). The example corresponds to the code shown below, where each comment indicates an automatically inserted statement (the syntax used for the automatically inserted constructor invocations isn’t valid, but merely serves to illustrate the mechanism).

```csharp
using System.Collections;

class A
{
    int x, y, count;

    public A ()
    {
        x = 1; // Variable initializer
        y = -1; // Variable initializer
        object (); // Invoke object() constructor
        count = 0;
    }

    public A (int n)
    {
        x = 1; // Variable initializer
        y = -1; // Variable initializer
        object (); // Invoke object() constructor
        count = n;
    }
}

class B : A
{
    double sqrt2;
    ArrayList items;
    int max;

    public B () : this (100)
    {
        B (100); // Invoke B(int) constructor
        items.Add ("default");
    }

    public B (int n) : base (n– 1)
    {
        sqrt2 = Math.Sqrt (2.0); // Variable initializer
        items = new ArrayList (100); // Variable initializer
        A (n– 1); // Invoke A(int) constructor
        max = n;
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Default constructors

If a class contains no instance constructor declarations, a default instance constructor is automatically provided. That default constructor simply invokes a constructor of the direct base class, as if it had a constructor initializer of the form `base()`. If the class is abstract then the declared accessibility for the default constructor is protected. Otherwise, the declared accessibility for the default constructor is public. 

> [!NOTE]
> Thus, the default constructor is always of the form
> 
> ```csharp
> protected C(): base() {}
> ```
> 
> or
> 
> ```csharp
> public C(): base() {}
> ```
> 
> where C is the name of the class.

If overload resolution is unable to determine a unique best candidate for the base-class constructor initializer then a compile-time error occurs.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Message
{
    object sender;
    string text;
}
```

a default constructor is provided because the class contains no instance constructor declarations. Thus, the example is precisely equivalent to

```csharp
class Message
{
    object sender;
    string text;

    public Message () : base () { }
}
```

*end example*]

## Static constructors

A ***static constructor*** is a member that implements the actions required to initialize a closed class. Static constructors are declared using *static-constructor-declaration*s:

```antlr
static-constructor-declaration:
    attributesopt static-constructor-modifiers identifier ( ) static-constructor-body

static-constructor-modifiers:
    externopt static
    static externopt

static-constructor-body:
    block
    ;
```

A *static-constructor-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22) and an `extern` modifier (§15.6.8).

The *identifier* of a *static-constructor-declaration* shall name the class in which the static constructor is declared. If any other name is specified, a compile-time error occurs.

When a static constructor declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the static constructor is said to be an ***external static constructor***. Because an external static constructor declaration provides no actual implementation, its *static-constructor-body* consists of a semicolon. For all other static constructor declarations, the *static-constructor-body* consists of a *block*, which specifies the statements to execute in order to initialize the class. This corresponds exactly to the *method-body* of a static method with a void return type (§15.6.11).

Static constructors are not inherited, and cannot be called directly.

The static constructor for a closed class executes at most once in a given application domain. The execution of a static constructor is triggered by the first of the following events to occur within an application domain:

- An instance of the class is created.
- Any of the static members of the class are referenced.

If a class contains the `Main` method (§8.1) in which execution begins, the static constructor for that class executes before the `Main` method is called.

To initialize a new closed class type, first a new set of static fields (§15.5.2) for that particular closed type is created. Each of the static fields is initialized to its default value (§15.5.5). Next, the static field initializers (§15.5.6.2) are executed for those static fields. Finally, the static constructor is executed.[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        A.F ();
        B.F ();
    }
}

class A
{
    static A ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Init A");
    }
    public static void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("A.F");
    }
}

class B
{
    static B ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Init B");
    }
    public static void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("B.F");
    }
}
```

must produce the output:

```plaintext
Init A
A.F
Init B
B.F
```

because the execution of `A`'s static constructor is triggered by the call to `A.F`, and the execution of `B`'s static constructor is triggered by the call to `B.F`. *end example*]

It is possible to construct circular dependencies that allow static fields with variable initializers to be observed in their default value state.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    public static int X;
    static A ()
    {
        X = B.Y + 1;
    }
}

class B
{
    public static int Y = A.X + 1;
    static B () { }
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("X = {0}, Y = {1}", A.X, B.Y);
    }
}
```

produces the output

```plaintext
X = 1, Y = 2
```

To execute the `Main` method, the system first runs the initializer for `B.Y`, prior to class `B`'s static constructor. `Y`'s initializer causes `A`'s static constructor to be run because the value of `A.X` is referenced. The static constructor of `A` in turn proceeds to compute the value of `X`, and in doing so fetches the default value of Y, which is zero. `A.X` is thus initialized to 1. The process of running `A`'s static field initializers and static constructor then completes, returning to the calculation of the initial value of `Y`, the result of which becomes 2. *end example*]

Because the static constructor is executed exactly once for each closed constructed class type, it is a convenient place to enforce run-time checks on the type parameter that cannot be checked at compile-time via constraints (§15.2.5). [*Example*: The following type uses a static constructor to enforce that the type argument is an enum:

```csharp
class Gen<T> where T : struct
{
    static Gen ()
    {
        if (!typeof (T).IsEnum)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException ("T must be an enum");
        }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

## Finalizers

> [!NOTE]
> In an earlier version of this standard, what is now referred to as a "finalizer" was called a "destructor". Experience has shown that the term "destructor" caused confusion and often resulted to incorrect expectations, especially to programmers knowing C++. In C++, a destructor is called in a determinate manner, whereas, in C#, a finalizer is not. To get determinate behavior from C#, one should use `Dispose`.

A ***finalizer*** is a member that implements the actions required to finalize an instance of a class. A finalizer is declared using a *finalizer-declaration*:

```antlr
finalizer-declaration:
    attributesopt externopt ~ identifier ( ) finalizer-body

finalizer-body:
    block
    ;
```

A *finalizer-declaration* may include a set of *attributes* (§22).

The *identifier* of a *finalizer-declarator* shall name the class in which the finalizer is declared. If any other name is specified, a compile-time error occurs.

When a finalizer declaration includes an `extern` modifier, the finalizer is said to be an ***external finalizer***. Because an external finalizer declaration provides no actual implementation, its *finalizer-body* consists of a semicolon. For all other finalizers, the *finalizer-body* consists of a *block*, which specifies the statements to execute in order to finalize an instance of the class. A *finalizer-body* corresponds exactly to the *method-body* of an instance method with a `void` return type (§15.6.11).

Finalizers are not inherited. Thus, a class has no finalizers other than the one that may be declared in that class.

> [!NOTE]
> Since a finalizer is required to have no parameters, it cannot be overloaded, so a class can have, at most, one finalizer.

Finalizers are invoked automatically, and cannot be invoked explicitly. An instance becomes eligible for finalization when it is no longer possible for any code to use that instance. Execution of the finalizer for the instance may occur at any time after the instance becomes eligible for finalization (§8.9). When an instance is finalized, the finalizers in that instance’s inheritance chain are called, in order, from most derived to least derived. A finalizer may be executed on any thread. For further discussion of the rules that govern when and how a finalizer is executed, see §8.9.

[*Example*: The output of the example

```csharp
using System;

class A
{
    ~A ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("A's finalizer");
    }
}

class B : A
{
    ~B ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("B's finalizer");
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b = new B ();
        b = null;
        GC.Collect ();
        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers ();
    }
}
```

is

```plaintext
B’s finalizer
A’s finalizer
```

since finalizers in an inheritance chain are called in order, from most derived to least derived. *end example*]

Finalizers are implemented by overriding the virtual method `Finalize` on `System.Object`. C# programs are not permitted to override this method or call it (or overrides of it) directly. [*Example*: For instance, the program

```csharp
class A
{
    override protected void Finalize () { } // error
    public void F ()
    {
        this.Finalize (); // error
    }
}
```

contains two errors. *end example*]

The compiler behaves as if this method, and overrides of it, do not exist at all. [*Example*: Thus, this program:

```csharp
class A
{
    void Finalize () { } // permitted
}
```

is valid and the method shown hides `System.Object`'s `Finalize` method. *end example*]

For a discussion of the behavior when an exception is thrown from a finalizer, see §21.4.

## Iterators

### General

A function member (§12.6) implemented using an iterator block (§13.3) is called an ***iterator***.

An iterator block may be used as the body of a function member as long as the return type of the corresponding function member is one of the enumerator interfaces (§15.14.2) or one of the enumerable interfaces (§15.14.3). It may occur as a *method-body*, *operator-body* or *accessor-body*, whereas events, instance constructors, static constructors and finalizers may not be implemented as iterators.

When a function member is implemented using an iterator block, it is a compile-time error for the formal parameter list of the function member to specify any ref or out parameters.

### Enumerator interfaces

The ***enumerator interfaces*** are the non-generic interface `System.Collections.IEnumerator` and all instantiations of the generic interface `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator<T>`. For the sake of brevity, in this subclause and its siblings these interfaces are referenced as `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerator<T>`, respectively.

### Enumerable interfaces

The ***enumerable interfaces*** are the non-generic interface `System.Collections.IEnumerable` and all instantiations of the generic interface `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>`. For the sake of brevity, in this subclause and its siblings these interfaces are referenced as `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerable<T>`, respectively.

### Yield type

An iterator produces a sequence of values, all of the same type. This type is called the ***yield type*** of the iterator.

- The yield type of an iterator that returns `IEnumerator` or `IEnumerable` is `object`.
- The yield type of an iterator that returns `IEnumerator<T>` or `IEnumerable<T>` is `T`.

### Enumerator objects

#### General

When a function member returning an enumerator interface type is implemented using an iterator block, invoking the function member does not immediately execute the code in the iterator block. Instead, an ***enumerator object*** is created and returned. This object encapsulates the code specified in the iterator block, and execution of the code in the iterator block occurs when the enumerator object’s `MoveNext` method is invoked. An enumerator object has the following characteristics:

- It implements `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerator<T>`, where `T` is the yield type of the iterator.
- It implements `System.IDisposable`.
- It is initialized with a copy of the argument values (if any) and instance value passed to the function member.
- It has four potential states, ***before***, ***running***, ***suspended***, and ***after***, and is initially in the ***before*** state.

An enumerator object is typically an instance of a compiler-generated enumerator class that encapsulates the code in the iterator block and implements the enumerator interfaces, but other methods of implementation are possible. If an enumerator class is generated by the compiler, that class will be nested, directly or indirectly, in the class containing the function member, it will have private accessibility, and it will have a name reserved for compiler use (§7.4.3).

An enumerator object may implement more interfaces than those specified above.

The following subclauses describe the required behavior of the `MoveNext`, `Current`, and `Dispose` members of the `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerator<T>` interface implementations provided by an enumerator object.

Enumerator objects do not support the `IEnumerator.Reset` method. Invoking this method causes a `System.NotSupportedException` to be thrown.

#### The MoveNext method

The `MoveNext` method of an enumerator object encapsulates the code of an iterator block. Invoking the `MoveNext` method executes code in the iterator block and sets the `Current` property of the enumerator object as appropriate. The precise action performed by `MoveNext` depends on the state of the enumerator object when `MoveNext` is invoked:

- If the state of the enumerator object is ***before***, invoking `MoveNext`:
  - Changes the state to ***running***.
  - Initializes the parameters (including `this`) of the iterator block to the argument values and instance value saved when the enumerator object was initialized.
  - Executes the iterator block from the beginning until execution is interrupted (as described below).
- If the state of the enumerator object is ***running***, the result of invoking `MoveNext` is unspecified.
- If the state of the enumerator object is ***suspended***, invoking `MoveNext`:
  - Changes the state to ***running***.
  - Restores the values of all local variables and parameters (including `this`) to the values saved when execution of the iterator block was last suspended. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > The contents of any objects referenced by these variables may have changed since the previous call to `MoveNext`. 
  - Resumes execution of the iterator block immediately following the `yield return` statement that caused the suspension of execution and continues until execution is interrupted (as described below).
- If the state of the enumerator object is ***after***, invoking `MoveNext` returns `false`.

When `MoveNext` executes the iterator block, execution can be interrupted in four ways: By a `yield return` statement, by a `yield break` statement, by encountering the end of the iterator block, and by an exception being thrown and propagated out of the iterator block.

- When a `yield return` statement is encountered (§10.4.4.20):
  - The expression given in the statement is evaluated, implicitly converted to the yield type, and assigned to the `Current` property of the enumerator object.
  - Execution of the iterator body is suspended. The values of all local variables and parameters (including `this`) are saved, as is the location of this `yield return` statement. If the `yield return` statement is within one or more try blocks, the associated finally blocks are *not* executed at this time.
  - The state of the enumerator object is changed to ***suspended***.
  - The `MoveNext` method returns true to its caller, indicating that the iteration successfully advanced to the next value.
- When a `yield break` statement is encountered (§10.4.4.20):
  - If the `yield break` statement is within one or more try blocks, the associated finally blocks are executed.
  - The state of the enumerator object is changed to ***after***.
  - The `MoveNext` method returns false to its caller, indicating that the iteration is complete.
- When the end of the iterator body is encountered:
  - The state of the enumerator object is changed to ***after***.
  - The `MoveNext` method returns false to its caller, indicating that the iteration is complete.
- When an exception is thrown and propagated out of the iterator block:
  - Appropriate finally blocks in the iterator body will have been executed by the exception propagation.
  - The state of the enumerator object is changed to ***after***.
  - The exception propagation continues to the caller of the `MoveNext` method.

#### The Current property

An enumerator object’s `Current` property is affected by `yield return` statements in the iterator block.

When an enumerator object is in the ***suspended*** state, the value of `Current` is the value set by the previous call to `MoveNext`. When an enumerator object is in the ***before***, ***running***, or ***after*** states, the result of accessing `Current` is unspecified.

For an iterator with a yield type other than `object`, the result of accessing `Current` through the enumerator object’s `IEnumerable` implementation corresponds to accessing `Current` through the enumerator object’s `IEnumerator<T>` implementation and casting the result to `object`.

#### The Dispose method

The `Dispose` method is used to clean up the iteration by bringing the enumerator object to the ***after*** state.

- If the state of the enumerator object is ***before***, invoking `Dispose` changes the state to ***after***.
- If the state of the enumerator object is ***running***, the result of invoking `Dispose` is unspecified.
- If the state of the enumerator object is ***suspended***, invoking `Dispose`:
  - Changes the state to ***running***.
  - Executes any finally blocks as if the last executed yield return statement were a `yield break` statement. If this causes an exception to be thrown and propagated out of the iterator body, the state of the enumerator object is set to ***after*** and the exception is propagated to the caller of the `Dispose` method.
  - Changes the state to ***after***.
- If the state of the enumerator object is ***after***, invoking `Dispose` has no affect.

### Enumerable objects

#### General

When a function member returning an enumerable interface type is implemented using an iterator block, invoking the function member does not immediately execute the code in the iterator block. Instead, an ***enumerable object*** is created and returned. The enumerable object’s `GetEnumerator` method returns an enumerator object that encapsulates the code specified in the iterator block, and execution of the code in the iterator block occurs when the enumerator object’s MoveNext method is invoked. An enumerable object has the following characteristics:

- It implements `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerable<T>`, where `T` is the yield type of the iterator.
- It is initialized with a copy of the argument values (if any) and instance value passed to the function member.

An enumerable object is typically an instance of a compiler-generated enumerable class that encapsulates the code in the iterator block and implements the enumerable interfaces, but other methods of implementation are possible. If an enumerable class is generated by the compiler, that class will be nested, directly or indirectly, in the class containing the function member, it will have private accessibility, and it will have a name reserved for compiler use (§7.4.3).

An enumerable object may implement more interfaces than those specified above. 

> [!NOTE]
> For example, an enumerable object may also implement `IEnumerator` and `IEnumerator<T>`, enabling it to serve as both an enumerable and an enumerator. Typically, such an implementation would return its own instance (to save allocations) from the first call to `GetEnumerator`. Subsequent invocations of `GetEnumerator`, if any, would return a new class instance, typically of the same class, so that calls to different enumerator instances will not affect each other. It cannot return the same instance even if the previous enumerator has already enumerated past the end of the sequence, since all future calls to an exhausted enumerator must throw exceptions.

#### The GetEnumerator method

An enumerable object provides an implementation of the `GetEnumerator` methods of the `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerable<T>` interfaces. The two `GetEnumerator` methods share a common implementation that acquires and returns an available enumerator object. The enumerator object is initialized with the argument values and instance value saved when the enumerable object was initialized, but otherwise the enumerator object functions as described in §15.14.5.

## Async Functions

### General

A method (§15.6) or anonymous function (§12.16) with the `async` modifier is called an ***async function***. In general, the term ***async*** is used to describe any kind of function that has the `async` modifier.

It is a compile-time error for the formal parameter list of an async function to specify any `ref` or `out` parameters.

The *return-type* of an async method shall be either `void` or a ***task type***. The task types are `System.Threading.Tasks.Task` and types constructed from `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<T>`. For the sake of brevity, in this chapter these types are referenced as `Task` and `Task<T>`, respectively. An async method returning a task type is said to be ***task-returning***.

The exact definition of the task types is implementation-defined, but from the language’s point of view, a task type is in one of the states *incomplete*, *succeeded* or *faulted*. A *faulted* task records a pertinent exception. A *succeeded* `Task<*T*>` records a result of type *`T`*. Task types are awaitable, and tasks can therefore be the operands of await expressions (§12.8.8).

An async function has the ability to suspend evaluation by means of await expressions (§12.8.8) in its body. Evaluation may later be resumed at the point of the suspending await expression by means of a ***resumption delegate***. The resumption delegate is of type `System.Action`, and when it is invoked, evaluation of the async function invocation will resume from the await expression where it left off. The ***current caller*** of an async function invocation is the original caller if the function invocation has never been suspended or the most recent caller of the resumption delegate otherwise.

### Evaluation of a task-returning async function

Invocation of a task-returning async function causes an instance of the returned task type to be generated. This is called the ***return task*** of the async function. The task is initially in an *incomplete* state.

The async function body is then evaluated until it is either suspended (by reaching an await expression) or terminates, at which point control is returned to the caller, along with the return task.

When the body of the async function terminates, the return task is moved out of the incomplete state:

- If the function body terminates as the result of reaching a return statement or the end of the body, any result value is recorded in the return task, which is put into a *succeeded* state.
- If the function body terminates as the result of an uncaught exception (§13.10.6) the exception is recorded in the return task which is put into a *faulted* state.

### Evaluation of a void-returning async function

If the return type of the async function is `void`, evaluation differs from the above in the following way: Because no task is returned, the function instead communicates completion and exceptions to the current thread’s ***synchronization context***. The exact definition of synchronization context is implementation-dependent, but is a representation of “where” the current thread is running. The synchronization context is notified when evaluation of a void-returning async function commences, completes successfully, or causes an uncaught exception to be thrown.

This allows the context to keep track of how many void-returning async functions are running under it, and to decide how to propagate exceptions coming out of them.

# Structs

## General

Structs are similar to classes in that they represent data structures that can contain data members and function members. However, unlike classes, structs are value types and do not require heap allocation. A variable of a struct type directly contains the data of the struct, whereas a variable of a class type contains a reference to the data, the latter known as an object.

> [!NOTE]
> Structs are particularly useful for small data structures that have value semantics. Complex numbers, points in a coordinate system, or key-value pairs in a dictionary are all good examples of structs. Key to these data structures is that they have few data members, that they do not require use of inheritance or referential identity, and that they can be conveniently implemented using value semantics where assignment copies the value instead of the reference.

As described in §9.3.5, the simple types provided by C#, such as `int`, `double`, and `bool`, are, in fact, all struct types.

## Struct declarations

### General

A *struct-declaration* is a *type-declaration* (§14.7) that declares a new struct:

```antlr
struct-declaration:
    attributesopt struct-modifiersopt partialopt struct identifier type-parameter-listopt
    struct-interfacesopt type-parameter-constraints-clausesopt struct-body ;opt
```

A *struct-declaration* consists of an optional set of *attributes* (§22), followed by an optional set of *struct-modifiers* (§16.2.2), followed by an optional partial modifier (§15.2.7), followed by the keyword `struct` and an *identifier* that names the struct, followed by an optional *type-parameter-list* specification (§15.2.3), followed by an optional *struct-interfaces* specification (§16.2.4), followed by an optional *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* specification (§15.2.5), followed by a *struct-body* (§16.2.5), optionally followed by a semicolon.

A struct declaration shall not supply a *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* unless it also supplies a *type-parameter-list*.

A struct declaration that supplies a *type-parameter-list* is a generic struct declaration.

### Struct modifiers

A *struct-declaration* may optionally include a sequence of struct modifiers:

```antlr
struct-modifiers:
    struct-modifier
    struct-modifiers struct-modifier

struct-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
```

It is a compile-time error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in a struct declaration.

The modifiers of a struct declaration have the same meaning as those of a class declaration (§15.2.2).

### Partial modifier

The `partial` modifier indicates that this *struct-declaration* is a partial type declaration. Multiple partial struct declarations with the same name within an enclosing namespace or type declaration combine to form one struct declaration, following the rules specified in §15.2.7.

### Struct interfaces

A struct declaration may include a *struct-interfaces* specification, in which case the struct is said to directly implement the given interface types. For a constructed struct type, including a nested type declared within a generic type declaration (§15.3.9.7), each implemented interface type is obtained by substituting, for each *type-parameter* in the given interface, the corresponding *type-argument* of the constructed type.

```antlr
struct-interfaces:
    : interface-type-list
```

The handling of interfaces on multiple parts of a partial struct declaration (§15.2.7) are discussed further in §15.2.4.3.

Interface implementations are discussed further in §18.6.

### Struct body

The *struct-body* of a struct defines the members of the struct.

```antlr
struct-body:
    { struct-member-declarationsopt }
```

## Struct members

The members of a struct consist of the members introduced by its *struct-member-declaration*s and the members inherited from the type `System.ValueType`.

```antlr
struct-member-declarations:
    struct-member-declaration
    struct-member-declarations struct-member-declaration

struct-member-declaration:
    constant-declaration
    field-declaration
    method-declaration
    property-declaration
    event-declaration
    indexer-declaration
    operator-declaration
    constructor-declaration
    static-constructor-declaration
    type-declaration
```

> [!NOTE]
> All kinds of *class-member-declaration*s except *finalizer-declaration* are also *struct-member-declaration*s.

Except for the differences noted in §16.4, the descriptions of class members provided in §15.3 through §15.12 apply to struct members as well.

## Class and struct differences

### General

Structs differ from classes in several important ways:

- Structs are value types (§16.4.2).
- All struct types implicitly inherit from the class `System.ValueType` (§16.4.3).
- Assignment to a variable of a struct type creates a *copy* of the value being assigned (§16.4.4).
- The default value of a struct is the value produced by setting all fields to their default value (§16.4.5).
- Boxing and unboxing operations are used to convert between a struct type and certain reference types (§16.4.6).
- The meaning of `this` is different within struct members (§16.4.7).
- Instance field declarations for a struct are not permitted to include variable initializers (§16.4.8).
- A struct is not permitted to declare a parameterless instance constructor (§16.4.9).
- A struct is not permitted to declare a finalizer.

### Value semantics

Structs are value types (§9.3) and are said to have value semantics. Classes, on the other hand, are reference types (§9.2) and are said to have reference semantics.

A variable of a struct type directly contains the data of the struct, whereas a variable of a class type contains a reference to an object that contains the data. When a struct `B` contains an instance field of type `A` and `A` is a struct type, it is a compile-time error for `A` to depend on `B` or a type constructed from `B`. A struct `X` ***directly depends on*** a struct `Y` if `X` contains an instance field of type `Y`. Given this definition, the complete set of structs upon which a struct depends is the transitive closure of the ***directly depends on*** relationship. [*Example*:

```csharp
struct Node
{
    int data;

    Node next; // error, Node directly depends on itself

}
```

is an error because Node contains an instance field of its own type. Another example

```csharp
struct A { B b; }

struct B { C c; }

struct C { A a; }
```

is an error because each of the types `A`, `B`, and `C` depend on each other. *end example*]

With classes, it is possible for two variables to reference the same object, and thus possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With structs, the variables each have their own copy of the data (except in the case of ref and out parameter variables), and it is not possible for operations on one to affect the other. Furthermore, except when explicitly nullable (§9.3.11), it is not possible for values of a struct type to be `null`. 

> [!NOTE]
> If a struct contains a field of reference type then the contents of the object referenced can be altered by other operations. However the value of the field itself, i.e., which object it references, cannot be changed through a mutation of a different struct value.

[*Example*: Given the declaration

```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int x, y;

    public Point (int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

the code fragment

```csharp
Point a = new Point(10, 10);
Point b = a;
a.x = 100;
System.Console.WriteLine(b.x);
```

outputs the value 10. The assignment of `a` to `b` creates a copy of the value, and `b` is thus unaffected by the assignment to `a.x`. Had `Point` instead been declared as a class, the output would be 100 because `a` and `b` would reference the same object. *end example*]

### Inheritance

All struct types implicitly inherit from the class `System.ValueType`, which, in turn, inherits from class `object`. A struct declaration may specify a list of implemented interfaces, but it is not possible for a struct declaration to specify a base class.

Struct types are never abstract and are always implicitly sealed. The `abstract` and `sealed` modifiers are therefore not permitted in a struct declaration.

Since inheritance isn’t supported for structs, the declared accessibility of a struct member cannot be `protected` or `protected internal`.

Function members in a struct cannot be `abstract` or `virtual`, and the `override` modifier is allowed only to override methods inherited from `System.ValueType`.

### Assignment

Assignment to a variable of a struct type creates a *copy* of the value being assigned. This differs from assignment to a variable of a class type, which copies the reference but not the object identified by the reference.

Similar to an assignment, when a struct is passed as a value parameter or returned as the result of a function member, a copy of the struct is created. A struct may be passed by reference to a function member using a `ref` or `out` parameter.

When a property or indexer of a struct is the target of an assignment, the instance expression associated with the property or indexer access shall be classified as a variable. If the instance expression is classified as a value, a compile-time error occurs. This is described in further detail in §12.18.2.

### Default values

As described in §10.3, several kinds of variables are automatically initialized to their default value when they are created. For variables of class types and other reference types, this default value is `null`. However, since structs are value types that cannot be `null`, the default value of a struct is the value produced by setting all value type fields to their default value and all reference type fields to `null`.

[*Example*: Referring to the `Point` struct declared above, the example

```csharp
Point[] a = new Point[100];
```

initializes each `Point` in the array to the value produced by setting the `x` and `y` fields to zero. *end example*]

The default value of a struct corresponds to the value returned by the default constructor of the struct (§9.3.3). Unlike a class, a struct is not permitted to declare a parameterless instance constructor. Instead, every struct implicitly has a parameterless instance constructor, which always returns the value that results from setting all fields to their default values.

> [!NOTE]
> Structs should be designed to consider the default initialization state a valid state. In the example
> 
> using System;
> 
> struct KeyValuePair
> {
>     string key;
>     string value;
> 
>     public KeyValuePair (string key, string value)
>     {
>         if (key == null || value == null) throw new ArgumentException ();
>         this.key = key;
>         this.value = value;
>     }
> }
> 
> the user-defined instance constructor protects against null values only where it is explicitly called. In cases where a `KeyValuePair` variable is subject to default value initialization, the key and value fields will be null, and the struct should be prepared to handle this state. 

### Boxing and unboxing

A value of a class type can be converted to type `object` or to an interface type that is implemented by the class simply by treating the reference as another type at compile-time. Likewise, a value of type `object` or a value of an interface type can be converted back to a class type without changing the reference (but, of course, a run-time type check is required in this case).

Since structs are not reference types, these operations are implemented differently for struct types. When a value of a struct type is converted to certain reference types (as defined in §11.2.8), a boxing operation takes place. Likewise, when a value of certain reference types (as defined in §11.3.6) is converted back to a struct type, an unboxing operation takes place. A key difference from the same operations on class types is that boxing and unboxing *copies* the struct value either into or out of the boxed instance. 

> [!NOTE]
> Thus, following a boxing or unboxing operation, changes made to the unboxed struct are not reflected in the boxed struct.

For further details on boxing and unboxing, see §11.2.8 and §11.3.6.

### Meaning of this

The meaning of `this` in a struct differs from the meaning of `this` in a class, as described in §12.7.8.When a struct type overrides a virtual method inherited from `System.ValueType` (such as `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, or `ToString`), invocation of the virtual method through an instance of the struct type does not cause boxing to occur. This is true even when the struct is used as a type parameter and the invocation occurs through an instance of the type parameter type. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

struct Counter
{
    int value;

    public override string ToString ()
    {
        value++;
        return value.ToString ();
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Test<T> () where T : new ()
    {
        T x = new T ();
        Console.WriteLine (x.ToString ());
        Console.WriteLine (x.ToString ());
        Console.WriteLine (x.ToString ());
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Test<Counter> ();
    }
}
```

The output of the program is:

```plaintext
1
2
3
```

Although it is bad style for `ToString` to have side effects, the example demonstrates that no boxing occurred for the three invocations of `x.ToString()`. *end example*]

Similarly, boxing never implicitly occurs when accessing a member on a constrained type parameter when the member is implemented within the value type. For example, suppose an interface `ICounter` contains a method `Increment`, which can be used to modify a value. If `ICounter` is used as a constraint, the implementation of the `Increment` method is called with a reference to the variable that `Increment` was called on, never a boxed copy. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

interface ICounter
{
    void Increment ();
}

struct Counter : ICounter
{
    int value;

    public override string ToString ()
    {
        return value.ToString ();
    }

    void ICounter.Increment ()
    {
        value++;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Test<T> () where T : ICounter, new ()
    {
        T x = new T ();
        Console.WriteLine (x);
        x.Increment (); // Modify x
        Console.WriteLine (x);
        ((ICounter) x).Increment (); // Modify boxed copy of x
        Console.WriteLine (x);
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Test<Counter> ();
    }
}
```

The first call to `Increment` modifies the value in the variable `x`. This is not equivalent to the second call to `Increment`, which modifies the value in a boxed copy of `x`. Thus, the output of the program is:

```plaintext
0
1
1
```

*end example*]

### Field initializers

As described in §16.4.5, the default value of a struct consists of the value that results from setting all value type fields to their default value and all reference type fields to `null`. For this reason, a struct does not permit instance field declarations to include variable initializers. This restriction applies only to instance fields. Static fields of a struct are permitted to include variable initializers. [*Example*: The following

```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int x = 1; // Error, initializer not permitted
    public int y = 1; // Error, initializer not permitted
}
```

is in error because the instance field declarations include variable initializers. *end example*]

### Constructors

Unlike a class, a struct is not permitted to declare a parameterless instance constructor. Instead, every struct implicitly has a parameterless instance constructor, which always returns the value that results from setting all value type fields to their default value and all reference type fields to `null` (§9.3.3). A struct can declare instance constructors having parameters. [*Example*:

```csharp
struct Point
{
    int x, y;

    public Point (int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

Given the above declaration, the statements

```csharp
Point p1 = new Point();
Point p2 = new Point(0, 0);
```

both create a `Point` with `x` and `y` initialized to zero. *end example*]

A struct instance constructor is not permitted to include a constructor initializer of the form `base(*argument-listopt*)`.

The `this` parameter of a struct instance constructor corresponds to an `out` parameter of the struct type. As such, this shall be definitely assigned (§10.4) at every location where the constructor returns. Similarly, it cannot be read (even implicitly) in the constructor body before being definitely assigned.

If the struct instance constructor specifies a constructor initializer, that initializer is considered a definite assignment to this that occurs prior to the body of the constructor. Therefore, the body itself has no initialization requirements. [*Example*: Consider the instance constructor implementation below:

```csharp
struct Point
{
    int x, y;

    public int X
    {
        set { x = value; }
    }

    public int Y
    {
        set { y = value; }
    }

    public Point (int x, int y)
    {
        X = x; // error, this is not yet definitely assigned
        Y = y; // error, this is not yet definitely assigned
    }
}
```

No instance function member (including the set accessors for the properties `X` and `Y`) can be called until all fields of the struct being constructed have been definitely assigned. Note, however, that if `Point` were a class instead of a struct, the instance constructor implementation would be permitted.

*end example*]

### Static constructors

Static constructors for structs follow most of the same rules as for classes. The execution of a static constructor for a struct type is triggered by the first of the following events to occur within an application domain:

- A static member of the struct type is referenced.
- An explicitly declared constructor of the struct type is called.

> [!NOTE]
> The creation of default values (§16.4.5) of struct types does not trigger the static constructor. (An example of this is the initial value of elements in an array.)

### Automatically implemented properties

Automatically implemented properties (§15.7.4) use hidden backing fields, which are only accessible to the property accessors. 

> [!NOTE]
> This access restriction means that constructors in structs containing automatically implemented properties often need an explicit constructor initializer where they would not otherwise need one, to satisfy the requirement of all fields being definitely assigned before any function member is invoked or the constructor returns.

# Arrays

## General

An array is a data structure that contains a number of variables that are accessed through computed indices. The variables contained in an array, also called the ***elements*** of the array, are all of the same type, and this type is called the ***element type*** of the array.

An array has a rank that determines the number of indices associated with each array element. The rank of an array is also referred to as the dimensions of the array. An array with a rank of one is called a ***single-dimensional array.*** An array with a rank greater than one is called a ***multi-dimensional array***. Specific sized multi-dimensional arrays are often referred to as two-dimensional arrays, three-dimensional arrays, and so on. Each dimension of an array has an associated length that is an integral number greater than or equal to zero. The dimension lengths are not part of the type of the array, but rather are established when an instance of the array type is created at run-time. The length of a dimension determines the valid range of indices for that dimension: For a dimension of length N, indices can range from 0 to N – 1 inclusive. The total number of elements in an array is the product of the lengths of each dimension in the array. If one or more of the dimensions of an array have a length of zero, the array is said to be empty.

Every array type is a reference type (§9.2). The element type of an array can be any type, including value types and array types.

## Array types

### General

The grammar productions for array types are provided in §9.2.1.

An array type is written as a *non-array-type* followed by one or more *rank-specifier*s*.*

A *non-array-type* is any *type* that is not itself an *array-type*.

The rank of an array type is given by the leftmost *rank-specifier* in the *array-type*: A *rank-specifier* indicates that the array is an array with a rank of one plus the number of “`,`” tokens in the *rank-specifier*.

The element type of an array type is the type that results from deleting the leftmost *rank-specifier*:

- An array type of the form `T[R]` is an array with rank `R` and a non-array element type `T`.
- An array type of the form `T[R][R1]…[RN]` is an array with rank `R` and an element type `T[R1]…[RN]`.

In effect, the *rank-specifier*s are read from left to right *before* the final non-array element type. [*Example*: The type `int[][,,][,]` is a single-dimensional array of three-dimensional arrays of two-dimensional arrays of `int`. *end example*]

At run-time, a value of an array type can be `null` or a reference to an instance of that array type. 

> [!NOTE]
> Following the rules of §17.6, the value may also be a reference to a covariant array type.

### The System.Array type

The type `System.Array` is the abstract base type of all array types. An implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7) exists from any array type to `System.Array` and to any interface type implemented by `System.Array`. An explicit reference conversion (§11.3.5) exists from `System.Array` and any interface type implemented by `System.Array` to any array type. `System.Array` is not itself an *array-type*. Rather, it is a *class-type* from which all *array-type*s are derived.

At run-time, a value of type `System.Array` can be `null` or a reference to an instance of any array type.

### Arrays and the generic collection interfaces

A single-dimensional array `T[]` implements the interface `System.Collections.Generic.IList<T>` (`IList<T>` for short) and its base interfaces. Accordingly, there is an implicit conversion from `T[]` to `IList<T>` and its base interfaces. In addition, if there is an implicit reference conversion from `S` to `T` then `S[]` implements `IList<T>` and there is an implicit reference conversion from `S[]` to `IList<T>` and its base interfaces (§11.2.7). If there is an explicit reference conversion from `S` to `T` then there is an explicit reference conversion from `S[]` to `IList<T>` and its base interfaces (§11.3.5).

Similarly, a single-dimensional array `T[]` also implements the interface `System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<T>` (`IReadOnlyList<T>` for short) and its base interfaces. Accordingly, there is an implicit conversion from `T[]` to `IReadOnlyList<T>` and its base interfaces. In addition, if there is an implicit reference conversion from `S` to `T` then `S[]` implements `IReadOnlyList<T>` and there is an implicit reference conversion from `S[]` to `IReadOnlyList<T>` and its base interfaces (§11.2.7). If there is an explicit reference conversion from `S` to `T` then there is an explicit reference conversion from `S[]` to `IReadOnlyList<T>` and its base interfaces (§11.3.5).

[*Example*: For example:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Test

{

    static void Main()

    {

        string[] sa = new string[5];

        object[] oa1 = new object[5];

        object[] oa2 = sa;

        IList<string> lst1 = sa; // Ok

        IList<string> lst2 = oa1; // Error, cast needed

        IList<object> lst3 = sa; // Ok

        IList<object> lst4 = oa1; // Ok

        IList<string> lst5 = (IList<string>) oa1; // Exception

        IList<string> lst6 = (IList<string>) oa2; // Ok

        IReadOnlyList<string> lst7 = sa; // Ok

        IReadOnlyList<string> lst8 = oa1; // Error, cast needed

        IReadOnlyList<object> lst9 = sa; // Ok

        IReadOnlyList<object> lst10 = oa1; // Ok

        IReadOnlyList<string> lst11 = (IReadOnlyList<string>) oa1;
        // Exception

        IReadOnlyList<string> lst12 = (IReadOnlyList<string>) oa2; // Ok

    }

}
```

The assignment `lst2 = oa1` generates a compile-time error since the conversion from `object[]` to `IList<string>` is an explicit conversion, not implicit. The cast `(IList<string>)oa1` will cause an exception to be thrown at run-time since `oa1` references an `object[]` and not a `string[]`. However the cast `(IList<string>)oa2` will not cause an exception to be thrown since `oa2` references a `string[]`. *end example*]

Whenever there is an implicit or explicit reference conversion from `S[]` to `IList<T>`, there is also an explicit reference conversion from `IList<T>` and its base interfaces to `S[]` (§11.3.5).

When an array type `S[]` implements `IList<T>`, some of the members of the implemented interface may throw exceptions. The precise behavior of the implementation of the interface is beyond the scope of this specification.

## Array creation

Array instances are created by *array-creation-expression*s (§12.7.11.5) or by field or local variable declarations that include an *array-initializer* (§17.7). Array instances can also be created implicitly as part of evaluating an argument list involving a parameter array (§15.6.2.5).

When an array instance is created, the rank and length of each dimension are established and then remain constant for the entire lifetime of the instance. In other words, it is not possible to change the rank of an existing array instance, nor is it possible to resize its dimensions.

An array instance is always of an array type. The `System.Array` type is an abstract type that cannot be instantiated.

Elements of arrays created by *array-creation-expression*s are always initialized to their default value (§10.3).

## Array element access

Array elements are accessed using *element-access* expressions (§12.7.7.2) of the form `A[I1, I2, …, IN]`, where `A` is an expression of an array type and each `IX` is an expression of type `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, or can be implicitly converted to one or more of these types. The result of an array element access is a variable, namely the array element selected by the indices.

The elements of an array can be enumerated using a `foreach` statement (§13.9.5).

## Array members

Every array type inherits the members declared by the `System.Array` type.

## Array covariance

For any two *reference-type*s `A` and `B`, if an implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7) or explicit reference conversion (§11.3.4) exists from `A` to `B`, then the same reference conversion also exists from the array type `A[R]` to the array type `B[R]`, where `R` is any given *rank-specifier* (but the same for both array types). This relationship is known as ***array covariance***. Array covariance, in particular, means that a value of an array type `A[R]` might actually be a reference to an instance of an array type `B[R]`, provided an implicit reference conversion exists from `B` to `A`.

Because of array covariance, assignments to elements of reference type arrays include a run-time check which ensures that the value being assigned to the array element is actually of a permitted type (§12.18.2). [*Example*:

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void Fill (object[] array, int index, int count, object value)
    {
        for (int i = index; i < index + count; i++) array[i] = value;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        string[] strings = new string[100];
        Fill (strings, 0, 100, "Undefined");
        Fill (strings, 0, 10, null);
        Fill (strings, 90, 10, 0);
    }
}
```

The assignment to `array[i]` in the `Fill` method implicitly includes a run-time check, which ensures that value is either a null reference or a reference to an object of a type that is compatible with the actual element type of array. In `Main`, the first two invocations of `Fill` succeed, but the third invocation causes a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` to be thrown upon executing the first assignment to `array[i]`. The exception occurs because a boxed `int` cannot be stored in a `string` array. *end example*]

Array covariance specifically does not extend to arrays of *value-type*s. For example, no conversion exists that permits an `int[]` to be treated as an `object[]`.

## Array initializers

Array initializers may be specified in field declarations (§15.5), local variable declarations (§13.6.2), and array creation expressions (§12.7.11.5):

```antlr
array-initializer:
    { variable-initializer-listopt }
    { variable-initializer-list , }

variable-initializer-list:
    variable-initializer
    variable-initializer-list , variable-initializer

variable-initializer:
    expression
    array-initializer
```

An array initializer consists of a sequence of variable initializers, enclosed by “`{`”and “`}`” tokens and separated by “`,`” tokens. Each variable initializer is an expression or, in the case of a multi-dimensional array, a nested array initializer.

The context in which an array initializer is used determines the type of the array being initialized. In an array creation expression, the array type immediately precedes the initializer, or is inferred from the expressions in the array initializer. In a field or variable declaration, the array type is the type of the field or variable being declared. When an array initializer is used in a field or variable declaration, [*Example*:

```csharp
int[] a = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
```

*end example*] it is simply shorthand for an equivalent array creation expression: [*Example*:

```csharp
int[] a = new int[] {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
```

*end example*]

For a single-dimensional array, the array initializer shall consist of a sequence of expressions, each having an implicit conversion to the element type of the array (§11.2). The expressions initialize array elements in increasing order, starting with the element at index zero. The number of expressions in the array initializer determines the length of the array instance being created. [*Example*: The array initializer above creates an `int[]` instance of length 5 and then initializes the instance with the following values:

```csharp
a[0] = 0; a[1] = 2; a[2] = 4; a[3] = 6; a[4] = 8;
```

*end example*]

For a multi-dimensional array, the array initializer shall have as many levels of nesting as there are dimensions in the array. The outermost nesting level corresponds to the leftmost dimension and the innermost nesting level corresponds to the rightmost dimension. The length of each dimension of the array is determined by the number of elements at the corresponding nesting level in the array initializer. For each nested array initializer, the number of elements shall be the same as the other array initializers at the same level. [*Example*: The example:

```csharp
int[,] b = {{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6, 7}, {8, 9}};
```

creates a two-dimensional array with a length of five for the leftmost dimension and a length of two for the rightmost dimension:

```csharp
int[,] b = new int[5, 2];
```

and then initializes the array instance with the following values:

```csharp
b[0, 0] = 0; b[0, 1] = 1;
b[1, 0] = 2; b[1, 1] = 3;
b[2, 0] = 4; b[2, 1] = 5;
b[3, 0] = 6; b[3, 1] = 7;
b[4, 0] = 8; b[4, 1] = 9;
```

*end example*]

If a dimension other than the rightmost is given with length zero, the subsequent dimensions are assumed to also have length zero. [*Example*:

```csharp
int[,] c = {};
```

creates a two-dimensional array with a length of zero for both the leftmost and the rightmost dimension:

```csharp
int[,] c = new int[0, 0];
```

*end example*]

When an array creation expression includes both explicit dimension lengths and an array initializer, the lengths shall be constant expressions and the number of elements at each nesting level shall match the corresponding dimension length. [*Example*: Here are some examples:

```csharp
int i = 3;
int[] x = new int[3] {0, 1, 2}; // OK
int[] y = new int[i] {0, 1, 2}; // Error, i not a constant
int[] z = new int[3] {0, 1, 2, 3}; // Error, length/initializer mismatch
```

Here, the initializer for `y` results in a compile-time error because the dimension length expression is not a constant, and the initializer for `z` results in a compile-time error because the length and the number of elements in the initializer do not agree. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> C# allows a trailing comma at the end of an *array-initializer*. This syntax provides flexibility in adding or deleting members from such a list, and simplifies machine generation of such lists.

# Interfaces

## General

An interface defines a contract. A class or struct that implements an interface shall adhere to its contract. An interface may inherit from multiple base interfaces, and a class or struct may implement multiple interfaces.

Interfaces can contain methods, properties, events, and indexers. The interface itself does not provide implementations for the members that it declares. The interface merely specifies the members that shall be supplied by classes or structs that implement the interface.

## Interface declarations

### General

An *interface-declaration* is a *type-declaration* (§14.7) that declares a new interface type.

```antlr
interface-declaration:
    attributesopt interface-modifiersopt partialopt interface
    identifier variant-type-parameter-listopt
    interface-baseopt type-parameter-constraints-clausesopt interface-body ;opt
```

An *interface-declaration* consists of an optional set of *attributes* (§22), followed by an optional set of *interface-modifiers* (§18.2.2), followed by an optional `partial` modifier (§15.2.7), followed by the keyword `interface` and an *identifier* that names the interface, followed by an optional *variant*-*type-parameter-list* specification (§18.2.3), followed by an optional *interface-base* specification (§18.2.4), followed by an optional *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* specification (§15.2.5), followed by an *interface-body* (§18.3), optionally followed by a semicolon.

An interface declaration shall not supply a *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* unless it also supplies a *type-parameter-list*.

An interface declaration that supplies a *type-parameter-list* is a generic interface declaration.

### Interface modifiers

An *interface-declaration* may optionally include a sequence of interface modifiers:

```antlr
interface-modifiers:
    interface-modifier
    interface-modifiers interface-modifier

interface-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
```

It is a compile-time error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in an interface declaration.

The `new` modifier is only permitted on interfaces defined within a class. It specifies that the interface hides an inherited member by the same name, as described in §15.3.5.

The `public`, `protected`, `internal`, and `private` modifiers control the accessibility of the interface. Depending on the context in which the interface declaration occurs, only some of these modifiers might be permitted (§8.5.2). When a partial type declaration (§15.2.7) includes an accessibility specification (via the `public`, `protected`, `internal`, and `private` modifiers), the rules in §15.2.2 apply.

### Variant type parameter lists

#### General

Variant type parameter lists can only occur on interface and delegate types. The difference from ordinary *type-parameter-list*s is the optional *variance-annotation* on each type parameter.

```antlr
variant-type-parameter-list:
    < variant-type-parameters >

variant-type-parameters:
    attributesopt variance-annotationopt type-parameter
    variant-type-parameters , attributesopt variance-annotationopt type-parameter

variance-annotation:
    in
    out
```

If the variance annotation is `out`, the type parameter is said to be ***covariant***. If the variance annotation is `in`, the type parameter is said to be ***contravariant***. If there is no variance annotation, the type parameter is said to be ***invariant***.

[*Example*: In the following:

```csharp
interface C<out X, in Y, Z>
{
    X M (Y y);

    Z P { get; set; }
}
```

`X` is covariant, `Y` is contravariant and `Z` is invariant. *end example*]

If a generic interface is declared in multiple parts (§15.2.3), each partial declaration shall specify the same variance for each type parameter.

#### Variance safety

The occurrence of variance annotations in the type parameter list of a type restricts the places where types can occur within the type declaration.

A type `T` is ***output-unsafe*** if one of the following holds:

- `T` is a contravariant type parameter
- `T` is an array type with an output-unsafe element type
- `T` is an interface or delegate type `S<A1,… AK>` constructed from a generic type `S<X1, … XK>` where for at least one `Ai` one of the following holds:
  - `Xi` is covariant or invariant and `Ai` is output-unsafe.
  - `Xi` is contravariant or invariant and `Ai` is input-unsafe.

A type `T` is ***input-unsafe*** if one of the following holds:

- `T` is a covariant type parameter
- `T` is an array type with an input-unsafe element type
- `T` is an interface or delegate type `S<A1,… AK>` constructed from a generic type `S<X1, … XK>` where for at least one `Ai` one of the following holds:
  - `Xi` is covariant or invariant and `Ai` is input-unsafe.
  - `Xi` is contravariant or invariant and `Ai` is output-unsafe.

Intuitively, an output-unsafe type is prohibited in an output position, and an input-unsafe type is prohibited in an input position.

A type is ***output-safe*** if it is not output-unsafe, and ***input-safe*** if it is not input-unsafe.

#### Variance conversion

The purpose of variance annotations is to provide for more lenient (but still type safe) conversions to interface and delegate types. To this end the definitions of implicit (§11.2) and explicit conversions (§11.3) make use of the notion of variance-convertibility, which is defined as follows:

A type `T<A1, …, An>` is variance-convertible to a type `T<B1, …, Bn>` if `T` is either an interface or a delegate type declared with the variant type parameters `T<X1, …, Xn>`, and for each variant type parameter `Xi` one of the following holds:

- `Xi` is covariant and an implicit reference or identity conversion exists from `Ai` to `Bi`
- `Xi` is contravariant and an implicit reference or identity conversion exists from `Bi` to `Ai`
- `Xi` is invariant and an identity conversion exists from `Ai` to `Bi`

### Base interfaces

An interface can inherit from zero or more interface types, which are called the ***explicit base interfaces*** of the interface. When an interface has one or more explicit base interfaces, then in the declaration of that interface, the interface identifier is followed by a colon and a comma-separated list of base interface types.

```antlr
interface-base:
    : interface-type-list
```

The explicit base interfaces can be constructed interface types (§9.4, §18.2). A base interface cannot be a type parameter on its own, though it can involve the type parameters that are in scope.

For a constructed interface type, the explicit base interfaces are formed by taking the explicit base interface declarations on the generic type declaration, and substituting, for each *type-parameter* in the base interface declaration, the corresponding *type-argument* of the constructed type.

The explicit base interfaces of an interface shall be at least as accessible as the interface itself (§8.5.5). [*Note*: For example, it is a compile-time error to specify a private or internal interface in the *interface-base* of a public interface. *end note*]

It is a compile-time error for an interface to directly or indirectly inherit from itself.

The ***base interfaces*** of an interface are the explicit base interfaces and their base interfaces. In other words, the set of base interfaces is the complete transitive closure of the explicit base interfaces, their explicit base interfaces, and so on. An interface inherits all members of its base interfaces. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

interface ITextBox : IControl
{
    void SetText (string text);
}

interface IListBox : IControl
{
    void SetItems (string[] items);
}

interface IComboBox : ITextBox, IListBox { }
```

the base interfaces of `IComboBox` are `IControl`, `ITextBox`, and `IListBox`. In other words, the `IComboBox` interface above inherits members `SetText` and `SetItems` as well as `Paint`. *end example*]

Members inherited from a constructed generic type are inherited after type substitution. That is, any constituent types in the member have the base class declaration’s type parameters replaced with the corresponding type arguments used in the *class-base* specification. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface IBase<T>
{
    T[] Combine (T a, T b);
}

interface IDerived : IBase<string[, ]>
{
    // Inherited: string[][,] Combine(string[,] a, string[,] b);
}
```

the interface `IDerived` inherits the `Combine` method after the type parameter `T` is replaced with `string[,]`. *end example*]

A class or struct that implements an interface also implicitly implements all of the interface’s base interfaces.

The handling of interfaces on multiple parts of a partial interface declaration (§15.2.7) are discussed further in §15.2.4.3.

Every base interface of an interface shall be output-safe (§18.2.3.2).

## Interface body

The *interface-body* of an interface defines the members of the interface.

```antlr
interface-body:
    { interface-member-declarationsopt }
```

## Interface members

### General

The members of an interface are the members inherited from the base interfaces and the members declared by the interface itself.

```antlr
interface-member-declarations:
    interface-member-declaration
    interface-member-declarations interface-member-declaration
    
interface-member-declaration:
    interface-method-declaration
    interface-property-declaration
    interface-event-declaration
    interface-indexer-declaration
```
An interface declaration declares zero or more members. The members of an interface shall be methods, properties, events, or indexers. An interface cannot contain constants, fields, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, or types, nor can an interface contain static members of any kind.

All interface members implicitly have `public` access. It is a compile-time error for interface member declarations to include any modifiers.

An *interface-declaration* creates a new declaration space (§8.3), and the type parameters and *interface-member-declarations* immediately contained by the *interface-declaration* introduce new members into this declaration space. The following rules apply to *interface-member-declaration*s:

- The name of a type parameter in the *type-parameter-list* of an interface declaration shall differ from the names of all other type parameters in the same *type-parameter-list* and shall differ from the names of all members of the interface.
- The name of a method shall differ from the names of all properties and events declared in the same interface. In addition, the signature (§8.6) of a method shall differ from the signatures of all other methods declared in the same interface, and two methods declared in the same interface may not have signatures that differ solely by `ref` and `out`.
- The name of a property or event shall differ from the names of all other members declared in the same interface.
- The signature of an indexer shall differ from the signatures of all other indexers declared in the same interface.

The inherited members of an interface are specifically not part of the declaration space of the interface. Thus, an interface is allowed to declare a member with the same name or signature as an inherited member. When this occurs, the derived interface member is said to *hide* the base interface member. Hiding an inherited member is not considered an error, but it does cause the compiler to issue a warning. To suppress the warning, the declaration of the derived interface member shall include a new modifier to indicate that the derived member is intended to hide the base member. This topic is discussed further in §8.7.2.3.

If a `new` modifier is included in a declaration that doesn’t hide an inherited member, a warning is issued to that effect. This warning is suppressed by removing the `new` modifier.

> [!NOTE]
> The members in class object are not, strictly speaking, members of any interface (§18.4). However, the members in class object are available via member lookup in any interface type (§12.5).

The set of members of an interface declared in multiple parts (§15.2.7) is the union of the members declared in each part. The bodies of all parts of the interface declaration share the same declaration space (§8.3), and the scope of each member (§8.7) extends to the bodies of all the parts.

### Interface methods

Interface methods are declared using *interface-method-declaration*s:

```antlr
interface-method-declaration:
    attributesopt newopt return-type identifier type-parameter-listopt
    ( formal-parameter-listopt ) type-parameter-constraints-clausesopt ;
```

The *attributes*, *return-type*, *identifier*, and *formal-parameter-list* of an interface method declaration have the same meaning as those of a method declaration in a class (§15.6). An interface method declaration is not permitted to specify a method body, and the declaration therefore always ends with a semicolon. An *interface-method-declaration* shall not have *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* unless it also has a *type-parameter-list*.

Each formal parameter type of an interface method shall be input-safe (§18.2.3.2), and the return type shall be either void or output-safe. In addition, any `out` or `ref` formal parameter types shall also be output-safe. 

> [!NOTE]
> Even `out` parameters are required to be input-safe, due to common implementation restrictions. 

Furthermore, each class type constraint, interface type constraint and type parameter constraint on any type parameter of the method shall be input-safe.

These rules ensure that any covariant or contravariant usage of the interface remains typesafe. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface I<out T> { void M<U>() where U : T; }
```

is ill-formed because the usage of `T` as a type parameter constraint on `U` is not input-safe.

Were this restriction not in place it would be possible to violate type safety in the following manner:

```csharp
class B { }
class D : B { }
class E : B { }
class C : I<D> { public void M<U> () {…} }
…
I<B> b = new C ();
b.M<E> ();
```

This is actually a call to `C.M<E>`. But that call requires that `E` derive from `D`, so type safety would be violated here. *end example*]

### Interface properties

Interface properties are declared using *interface-property-declaration*s:

```antlr
interface-property-declaration:
    attributesopt newopt type identifier { interface-accessors }

interface-accessors:
    attributesopt get ;
    attributesopt set ;
    attributesopt get ; attributesopt set ;
    attributesopt set ; attributesopt get ;
```

The *attributes*, *type*, and *identifier* of an interface property declaration have the same meaning as those of a property declaration in a class (§15.7).

The accessors of an interface property declaration correspond to the accessors of a class property declaration (§15.7.3), except that the accessor body shall always be a semicolon. Thus, the accessors simply indicate whether the property is read-write, read-only, or write-only.

The type of an interface property shall be output-safe if there is a get accessor, and shall be input-safe if there is a set accessor.

### Interface events

Interface events are declared using *interface-event-declaration*s:

```antlr
interface-event-declaration:
    attributesopt newopt event type identifier ;
```

The *attributes*, *type*, and *identifier* of an interface event declaration have the same meaning as those of an event declaration in a class (§15.8).

The type of an interface event shall be input-safe.

### Interface indexers

Interface indexers are declared using *interface-indexer-declaration*s:

```antlr
interface-indexer-declaration:
    attributesopt newopt type this [ formal-parameter-list ] { interface-accessors }
```

The *attributes*, *type*, and *formal-parameter-list* of an interface indexer declaration have the same meaning as those of an indexer declaration in a class (§15.9).

The accessors of an interface indexer declaration correspond to the accessors of a class indexer declaration (§15.9), except that the accessor body shall always be a semicolon. Thus, the accessors simply indicate whether the indexer is read-write, read-only, or write-only.

All the formal parameter types of an interface indexer shall be input-safe. In addition, any `out` or `ref` formal parameter types shall also be output-safe. 

> [!NOTE]
> Even `out` parameters are required to be input-safe, due to common implementation restrictions.

The type of an interface indexer shall be output-safe if there is a get accessor, and shall be input-safe if there is a set accessor.

### Interface member access

Interface members are accessed through member access (§12.7.5) and indexer access (§12.7.7.3) expressions of the form `I.M` and `I[A]`, where `I` is an interface type, `M` is a method, property, or event of that interface type, and `A` is an indexer argument list.

For interfaces that are strictly single-inheritance (each interface in the inheritance chain has exactly zero or one direct base interface), the effects of the member lookup (§12.5), method invocation (§12.7.6.2), and indexer access (§12.7.7.3) rules are exactly the same as for classes and structs: More derived members hide less derived members with the same name or signature. However, for multiple-inheritance interfaces, ambiguities can occur when two or more unrelated base interfaces declare members with the same name or signature. This subclause shows several examples, some of which lead to ambiguities and others which don't. In all cases, explicit casts can be used to resolve the ambiguities.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface IList
{
    int Count { get; set; }
}

interface ICounter
{
    void Count (int i);
}

interface IListCounter : IList, ICounter { }

class C
{
    void Test (IListCounter x)
    {
        x.Count (1); // Error
        x.Count = 1; // Error
        ((IList) x).Count = 1; // Ok, invokes IList.Count.set
        ((ICounter) x).Count (1); // Ok, invokes ICounter.Count
    }
}
```

the first two statements cause compile-time errors because the member lookup (§12.5) of `Count` in `IListCounter` is ambiguous. As illustrated by the example, the ambiguity is resolved by casting `x` to the appropriate base interface type. Such casts have no run-time costs—they merely consist of viewing the instance as a less derived type at compile-time. *end example*]

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface IInteger
{
    void Add (int i);
}

interface IDouble
{
    void Add (double d);
}

interface INumber : IInteger, IDouble { }

class C
{
    void Test (INumber n)
    {
        n.Add (1); // Invokes IInteger.Add
        n.Add (1.0); // Only IDouble.Add is applicable
        ((IInteger) n).Add (1); // Only IInteger.Add is a candidate
        ((IDouble) n).Add (1); // Only IDouble.Add is a candidate
    }
}
```

the invocation `n.Add(1)` selects `IInteger.Add` by applying overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. Similarly, the invocation `n.Add(1.0)` selects `IDouble.Add`. When explicit casts are inserted, there is only one candidate method, and thus no ambiguity. *end example*]

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface IBase
{
    void F (int i);
}

interface ILeft : IBase
{
    new void F (int i);
}

interface IRight : IBase
{
    void G ();
}

interface IDerived : ILeft, IRight { }

class A
{
    void Test (IDerived d)
    {
        d.F (1); // Invokes ILeft.F
        ((IBase) d).F (1); // Invokes IBase.F
        ((ILeft) d).F (1); // Invokes ILeft.F
        ((IRight) d).F (1); // Invokes IBase.F
    }
}
```

the `IBase.F` member is hidden by the `ILeft.F` member. The invocation `d.F(1)` thus selects `ILeft.F`, even though `IBase.F` appears to not be hidden in the access path that leads through `IRight`.

The intuitive rule for hiding in multiple-inheritance interfaces is simply this: If a member is hidden in any access path, it is hidden in all access paths. Because the access path from `IDerived` to `ILeft` to `IBase` hides `IBase.F`, the member is also hidden in the access path from `IDerived` to `IRight` to `IBase`. *end example*]

## Qualified interface member names

An interface member is sometimes referred to by its ***qualified interface member name***. The qualified name of an interface member consists of the name of the interface in which the member is declared, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the member. The qualified name of a member references the interface in which the member is declared. [*Example*: Given the declarations

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

interface ITextBox : IControl
{
    void SetText (string text);
}
```

the qualified name of `Paint` is `IControl.Paint` and the qualified name of `SetText` is `ITextBox.SetText`. In the example above, it is not possible to refer to `Paint` as `ITextBox.Paint`. *end example*]

When an interface is part of a namespace, a qualified interface member name can include the namespace name. [*Example*:

```csharp
namespace System
{
    public interface ICloneable
    {
        object Clone ();
    }
}
```

Within the `System` namespace, both `ICloneable.Clone` and `System.ICloneable.Clone` are qualified interface member names for the `Clone` method. *end example*]

## Interface implementations

### General

Interfaces may be implemented by classes and structs. To indicate that a class or struct directly implements an interface, the interface is included in the base class list of the class or struct. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface ICloneable
{
    object Clone ();
}

interface IComparable
{
    int CompareTo (object other);
}

class ListEntry : ICloneable, IComparable
{
    public object Clone () {…}

    public int CompareTo (object other) {…}
}
```

*end example*]

A class or struct that directly implements an interface also implicitly implements all of the interface’s base interfaces. This is true even if the class or struct doesn’t explicitly list all base interfaces in the base class list. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

interface ITextBox : IControl
{
    void SetText (string text);
}

class TextBox : ITextBox
{
    public void Paint () {…}

    public void SetText (string text) {…}
}
```

Here, class `TextBox` implements both `IControl` and `ITextBox`. *end example*]

When a class `C` directly implements an interface, all classes derived from `C` also implement the interface implicitly.

The base interfaces specified in a class declaration can be constructed interface types (§9.4, §18.2). [*Example*: The following code illustrates how a class can implement constructed interface types:

```csharp
class C<U, V> { }

interface I1<V> { }

class D : C<string, int>, I1<string> { }

class E<T> : C<int, T>, I1<T> { }
```

*end example*]

The base interfaces of a generic class declaration shall satisfy the uniqueness rule described in §18.6.3.

### Explicit interface member implementations

For purposes of implementing interfaces, a class or struct may declare ***explicit interface member implementations***. An explicit interface member implementation is a method, property, event, or indexer declaration that references a qualified interface member name. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IList<T>
{
    T[] GetElements ();
}

interface IDictionary<K, V>
{
    V this [K key];

    void Add (K key, V value);
}

class List<T> : IList<T>, IDictionary<int, T>
{
    public T[] GetElements () {…}

    T IDictionary<int, T>.this [int index] {…}

    void IDictionary<int, T>.Add (int index, T value) {…}
}
```

Here `IDictionary<int,T>.this` and `IDictionary<int,T>.Add` are explicit interface member implementations. *end example*]

[*Example*: In some cases, the name of an interface member might not be appropriate for the implementing class, in which case, the interface member may be implemented using explicit interface member implementation. A class implementing a file abstraction, for example, would likely implement a `Close` member function that has the effect of releasing the file resource, and implement the `Dispose` method of the `IDisposable` interface using explicit interface member implementation:

```csharp
interface IDisposable
{
    void Dispose ();
}

class MyFile : IDisposable
{
    void IDisposable.Dispose ()
    {
        Close ();
    }

    public void Close ()
    {
        // Do what's necessary to close the file
        System.GC.SuppressFinalize (this);
    }
}
```

*end example*]

It is not possible to access an explicit interface member implementation through its qualified interface member name in a method invocation, property access, event access, or indexer access. An explicit interface member implementation can only be accessed through an interface instance, and is in that case referenced simply by its member name.

It is a compile-time error for an explicit interface member implementation to include any modifiers (§15.6) other than `extern` or `async`.

It is a compile-time error for an explicit interface method implementation to include *type-parameter-constraints-clauses*. The constraints for a generic explicit interface method implementation are inherited from the interface method.

> [!NOTE]
> Explicit interface member implementations have different accessibility characteristics than other members. Because explicit interface member implementations are never accessible through a qualified interface member name in a method invocation or a property access, they are in a sense private. However, since they can be accessed through the interface, they are in a sense also as public as the interface in which they are declared.
> 
> Explicit interface member implementations serve two primary purposes:
> 
> - Because explicit interface member implementations are not accessible through class or struct instances, they allow interface implementations to be excluded from the public interface of a class or struct. This is particularly useful when a class or struct implements an internal interface that is of no interest to a consumer of that class or struct.
> - Explicit interface member implementations allow disambiguation of interface members with the same signature. Without explicit interface member implementations it would be impossible for a class or struct to have different implementations of interface members with the same signature and return type, as would it be impossible for a class or struct to have any implementation at all of interface members with the same signature but with different return types.

For an explicit interface member implementation to be valid, the class or struct shall name an interface in its base class list that contains a member whose qualified interface member name, type, number of type parameters, and parameter types exactly match those of the explicit interface member implementation. If an interface function member has a parameter array, the corresponding parameter of an associated explicit interface member implementation is allowed, but not required, to have the params modifier. If the interface function member does not have a parameter array then an associated explicit interface member implementation shall not have a parameter array. [*Example*: Thus, in the following class

```csharp
class Shape : ICloneable
{
    object ICloneable.Clone () {…}

    int IComparable.CompareTo (object other) {…} // invalid
}
```

the declaration of `IComparable.CompareTo` results in a compile-time error because `IComparable` is not listed in the base class list of `Shape` and is not a base interface of `ICloneable`. Likewise, in the declarations

```csharp
class Shape : ICloneable
{
    object ICloneable.Clone () {…}
}

class Ellipse : Shape
{
    object ICloneable.Clone () {…} // invalid
}
```

the declaration of `ICloneable.Clone` in `Ellipse` results in a compile-time error because `ICloneable` is not explicitly listed in the base class list of `Ellipse`. *end example*]

The qualified interface member name of an explicit interface member implementation shall reference the interface in which the member was declared. [*Example*: Thus, in the declarations

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

interface ITextBox : IControl
{
    void SetText (string text);
}

class TextBox : ITextBox
{
    void IControl.Paint () {…}

    void ITextBox.SetText (string text) {…}
}
```

the explicit interface member implementation of `Paint` must be written as `IControl.Paint`, not `ITextBox.Paint`. *end example*]

### Uniqueness of implemented interfaces

The interfaces implemented by a generic type declaration shall remain unique for all possible constructed types. Without this rule, it would be impossible to determine the correct method to call for certain constructed types. [*Example*: Suppose a generic class declaration were permitted to be written as follows:

```csharp
interface I<T>
{
    void F ();
}

class X<U, V> : I<U>, I<V> // Error: I<U> and I<V> conflict
{
    void I<U>.F () {…}
    void I<V>.F () {…}
}
```

Were this permitted, it would be impossible to determine which code to execute in the following case:

```csharp
I<int> x = new X<int,int>();
x.F();
```

*end example*]

To determine if the interface list of a generic type declaration is valid, the following steps are performed:

- Let `L` be the list of interfaces directly specified in a generic class, struct, or interface declaration `C`.
- Add to L any base interfaces of the interfaces already in `L`.
- Remove any duplicates from `L`.
- If any possible constructed type created from `C` would, after type arguments are substituted into L, cause two interfaces in `L` to be identical, then the declaration of `C` is invalid. Constraint declarations are not considered when determining all possible constructed types.

> [!NOTE]
> In the class declaration `X` above, the interface list `L` consists of `I<U>` and `I<V>`. The declaration is invalid because any constructed type with `U` and `V` being the same type would cause these two interfaces to be identical types.

It is possible for interfaces specified at different inheritance levels to unify:

```csharp
interface I<T>
{
    void F ();
}

class Base<U> : I<U>
{
    void I<U>.F () {…}
}

class Derived<U, V> : Base<U>, I<V> // Ok
{
    void I<V>.F () {…}
}
```

This code is valid even though `Derived<U,V>` implements both `I<U>` and `I<V>`. The code

```csharp
I<int> x = new Derived<int,int>();
x.F();
```

invokes the method in `Derived`, since `Derived<int,int>` effectively re-implements `I<int>` (§18.6.7).

### Implementation of generic methods

When a generic method implicitly implements an interface method, the constraints given for each method type parameter shall be equivalent in both declarations (after any interface type parameters are replaced with the appropriate type arguments), where method type parameters are identified by ordinal positions, left to right. [*Example*: In the following code:

```csharp
interface I<X, Y, Z>
{
    void F<T> (T t) where T : X;
    void G<T> (T t) where T : Y;
    void H<T> (T t) where T : Z;
}

class C : I<object, C, string>
{
    public void F<T> (T t) {…} // Ok
    public void G<T> (T t) where T : C {…} // Ok
    public void H<T> (T t) where T : string {…} // Error
}
```

the method `C.F<T>` implicitly implements `I<object,C,string>.F<T>`. In this case, `C.F<T>` is not required (nor permitted) to specify the constraint `T: object` since `object` is an implicit constraint on all type parameters. The method `C.G<T>` implicitly implements `I<object,C,string>.G<T>` because the constraints match those in the interface, after the interface type parameters are replaced with the corresponding type arguments. The constraint for method `C.H<T>` is an error because sealed types (string in this case) cannot be used as constraints. Omitting the constraint would also be an error since constraints of implicit interface method implementations are required to match. Thus, it is impossible to implicitly implement `I<object,C,string>.H<T>`. This interface method can only be implemented using an explicit interface member implementation:

```csharp
class C : I<object, C, string>
{…

    public void H<U> (U u) where U : class {…}

    void I<object, C, string>.H<T> (T t)
    {
        string s = t; // Ok
        H<T> (t);
    }
}
```

In this case, the explicit interface member implementation invokes a public method having strictly weaker constraints. The assignment from `t` to `s` is valid since `T` inherits a constraint of `T: string`, even though this constraint is not expressible in source code. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> When a generic method explicitly implements an interface method no constraints are allowed on the implementing method (§15.7.1, §18.6.2).

### Interface mapping

A class or struct shall provide implementations of all members of the interfaces that are listed in the base class list of the class or struct. The process of locating implementations of interface members in an implementing class or struct is known as ***interface mapping***.

Interface mapping for a class or struct `C` locates an implementation for each member of each interface specified in the base class list of `C`. The implementation of a particular interface member `I.M`, where `I` is the interface in which the member `M` is declared, is determined by examining each class or struct `S`, starting with `C` and repeating for each successive base class of `C`, until a match is located:

- If `S` contains a declaration of an explicit interface member implementation that matches `I` and `M`, then this member is the implementation of `I.M`.
- Otherwise, if S contains a declaration of a non-static public member that matches `M`, then this member is the implementation of `I.M`. If more than one member matches, it is unspecified which member is the implementation of `I.M`. This situation can only occur if `S` is a constructed type where the two members as declared in the generic type have different signatures, but the type arguments make their signatures identical.

A compile-time error occurs if implementations cannot be located for all members of all interfaces specified in the base class list of `C`. The members of an interface include those members that are inherited from base interfaces.

Members of a constructed interface type are considered to have any type parameters replaced with the corresponding type arguments as specified in §15.3.3. [*Example*: For example, given the generic interface declaration:

```csharp
interface I<T>
{
    T F (int x, T[, ] y);
    T this [int y] { get; }
}
```

the constructed interface `I<string[]>` has the members:

```csharp
string[] F(int x, string[,][] y);
string[] this[int y] { get; }
```

*end example*]

For purposes of interface mapping, a class or struct member `A` matches an interface member `B` when:

- `A` and `B` are methods, and the name, type, and formal parameter lists of `A` and `B` are identical.
- `A` and `B` are properties, the name and type of `A` and `B` are identical, and A has the same accessors as `B` (`A` is permitted to have additional accessors if it is not an explicit interface member implementation).
- `A` and `B` are events, and the name and type of `A` and `B` are identical.
- `A` and `B` are indexers, the type and formal parameter lists of `A` and `B` are identical, and `A` has the same accessors as `B` (`A` is permitted to have additional accessors if it is not an explicit interface member implementation).

Notable implications of the interface-mapping algorithm are:

- Explicit interface member implementations take precedence over other members in the same class or struct when determining the class or struct member that implements an interface member.
- Neither non-public nor static members participate in interface mapping.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface ICloneable
{
    object Clone ();
}

class C : ICloneable
{
    object ICloneable.Clone () {…}

    public object Clone () {…}
}
```

the `ICloneable.Clone` member of `C` becomes the implementation of `Clone` in `ICloneable` because explicit interface member implementations take precedence over other members. *end example*]

If a class or struct implements two or more interfaces containing a member with the same name, type, and parameter types, it is possible to map each of those interface members onto a single class or struct member. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

interface IForm
{
    void Paint ();
}

class Page : IControl, IForm
{
    public void Paint () {…}
}
```

Here, the `Paint` methods of both `IControl` and `IForm` are mapped onto the `Paint` method in `Page`. It is of course also possible to have separate explicit interface member implementations for the two methods. *end example*]

If a class or struct implements an interface that contains hidden members, then some members may need to be implemented through explicit interface member implementations. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IBase
{
    int P { get; }
}

interface IDerived : IBase
{
    new int P ();
}
```

An implementation of this interface would require at least one explicit interface member implementation, and would take one of the following forms

```csharp
class C : IDerived
{
    int IBase.P { get {…} }

    int IDerived.P () {…}
}

class C : IDerived
{
    public int P { get {…} }

    int IDerived.P () {…}
}

class C : IDerived
{
    int IBase.P { get {…} }

    public int P () {…}
}
```

*end example*]

When a class implements multiple interfaces that have the same base interface, there can be only one implementation of the base interface. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

interface ITextBox : IControl
{
    void SetText (string text);
}

interface IListBox : IControl
{
    void SetItems (string[] items);
}

class ComboBox : IControl, ITextBox, IListBox
{
    void IControl.Paint () {…}

    void ITextBox.SetText (string text) {…}

    void IListBox.SetItems (string[] items) {…}
}
```

it is not possible to have separate implementations for the `IControl` named in the base class list, the `IControl` inherited by `ITextBox`, and the `IControl` inherited by `IListBox`. Indeed, there is no notion of a separate identity for these interfaces. Rather, the implementations of `ITextBox` and `IListBox` share the same implementation of `IControl`, and `ComboBox` is simply considered to implement three interfaces, `IControl`, `ITextBox`, and `IListBox`. *end example*]

The members of a base class participate in interface mapping. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
interface Interface1
{
    void F ();
}

class Class1
{
    public void F () { }

    public void G () { }
}

class Class2 : Class1, Interface1
{
    new public void G () { }
}
```

the method `F` in `Class1` is used in `Class2`'s implementation of `Interface1`. *end example*]

### Interface implementation inheritance

A class inherits all interface implementations provided by its base classes.

Without explicitly ***re-implementing*** an interface, a derived class cannot in any way alter the interface mappings it inherits from its base classes. [*Example*: In the declarations

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

class Control : IControl
{
    public void Paint () {…}
}

class TextBox : Control
{
    new public void Paint () {…}
}
```

the `Paint` method in `TextBox` hides the `Paint` method in `Control`, but it does not alter the mapping of `Control.Paint` onto `IControl.Paint`, and calls to `Paint` through class instances and interface instances will have the following effects

```csharp
Control c = new Control ();
TextBox t = new TextBox ();
IControl ic = c;
IControl it = t;
c.Paint (); // invokes Control.Paint();
t.Paint (); // invokes TextBox.Paint();
ic.Paint (); // invokes Control.Paint();
it.Paint (); // invokes Control.Paint();
```

*end example*]

However, when an interface method is mapped onto a virtual method in a class, it is possible for derived classes to override the virtual method and alter the implementation of the interface. [*Example*: Rewriting the declarations above to

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

class Control : IControl
{
    public virtual void Paint () {…}
}

class TextBox : Control
{
    public override void Paint () {…}
}
```

the following effects will now be observed

```csharp
Control c = new Control ();
TextBox t = new TextBox ();
IControl ic = c;
IControl it = t;
c.Paint (); // invokes Control.Paint();
t.Paint (); // invokes TextBox.Paint();
ic.Paint (); // invokes Control.Paint();
it.Paint (); // invokes TextBox.Paint();
```

*end example*]

Since explicit interface member implementations cannot be declared virtual, it is not possible to override an explicit interface member implementation. However, it is perfectly valid for an explicit interface member implementation to call another method, and that other method can be declared virtual to allow derived classes to override it. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

class Control : IControl
{
    void IControl.Paint () { PaintControl (); }

    protected virtual void PaintControl () {…}
}

class TextBox : Control
{
    protected override void PaintControl () {…}
}
```

Here, classes derived from Control can specialize the implementation of `IControl.Paint` by overriding the `PaintControl` method. *end example*]

### Interface re-implementation

A class that inherits an interface implementation is permitted to ***re-implement*** the interface by including it in the base class list.

A re-implementation of an interface follows exactly the same interface mapping rules as an initial implementation of an interface. Thus, the inherited interface mapping has no effect whatsoever on the interface mapping established for the re-implementation of the interface. [*Example*: In the declarations

```csharp
interface IControl
{
    void Paint ();
}

class Control : IControl
{
    void IControl.Paint () {…}
}

class MyControl : Control, IControl
{
    public void Paint () { }
}
```

the fact that `Control` maps `IControl.Paint` onto `Control.IControl.Paint` doesn’t affect the re-implementation in `MyControl`, which maps `IControl.Paint` onto `MyControl.Paint`. *end example*]

Inherited public member declarations and inherited explicit interface member declarations participate in the interface mapping process for re-implemented interfaces. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IMethods
{
    void F ();
    void G ();
    void H ();
    void I ();
}

class Base : IMethods
{
    void IMethods.F () { }
    void IMethods.G () { }
    public void H () { }
    public void I () { }
}

class Derived : Base, IMethods
{
    public void F () { }
    void IMethods.H () { }
}
```

Here, the implementation of `IMethods` in `Derived` maps the interface methods onto `Derived.F`, `Base.IMethods.G`, `Derived.IMethods.H`, and `Base.I`. *end example*]

When a class implements an interface, it implicitly also implements all that interface’s base interfaces. Likewise, a re-implementation of an interface is also implicitly a re-implementation of all of the interface’s base interfaces. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IBase
{
    void F ();
}

interface IDerived : IBase
{
    void G ();
}

class C : IDerived
{
    void IBase.F () {…}

    void IDerived.G () {…}
}

class D : C, IDerived
{
    public void F () {…}

    public void G () {…}
}
```

Here, the re-implementation of IDerived also re-implements `IBase`, mapping `IBase.F` onto `D.F`. *end example*]

### Abstract classes and interfaces

Like a non-abstract class, an abstract class shall provide implementations of all members of the interfaces that are listed in the base class list of the class. However, an abstract class is permitted to map interface methods onto abstract methods. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IMethods
{
    void F ();
    void G ();
}

abstract class C : IMethods
{
    public abstract void F ();
    public abstract void G ();
}
```

Here, the implementation of `IMethods` maps `F` and `G` onto abstract methods, which shall be overridden in non-abstract classes that derive from `C`. *end example*]

Explicit interface member implementations cannot be abstract, but explicit interface member implementations are of course permitted to call abstract methods. [*Example*:

```csharp
interface IMethods
{
    void F ();
    void G ();
}

abstract class C : IMethods
{
    void IMethods.F () { FF (); }
    void IMethods.G () { GG (); }
    protected abstract void FF ();
    protected abstract void GG ();
}
```

Here, non-abstract classes that derive from `C` would be required to override `FF` and `GG`, thus providing the actual implementation of `IMethods`. *end example*]

# Enums

## General

An ***enum type*** is a distinct value type (§9.2) that declares a set of named constants. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}
```

declares an enum type named `Color` with members `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`. *end example*]

## Enum declarations

An `enum` declaration declares a new enum type. An `enum` declaration begins with the keyword `enum`, and defines the name, accessibility, underlying type, and members of the enum.

```antlr
enum-declaration:
    attributesopt enum-modifiersopt enum identifier enum-baseopt enum-body ;opt

enum-base:
    : integral-type

enum-body:
    { enum-member-declarationsopt }
    { enum-member-declarations , }
```

Each enum type has a corresponding integral type called the ***underlying type*** of the enum type. This underlying type shall be able to represent all the enumerator values defined in the enumeration. An enum declaration may explicitly declare an underlying type of `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long` or `ulong`. 

> [!NOTE]
> `char` cannot be used as an underlying type. 

An enum declaration that does not explicitly declare an underlying type has an underlying type of `int`.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
enum Color : long
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}
```

declares an enum with an underlying type of `long`. *end example*] 

> [!NOTE]
> A developer might choose to use an underlying type of `long`, as in the example, to enable the use of values that are in the range of `long` but not in the range of `int`, or to preserve this option for the future. 

> [!NOTE]
> C# allows a trailing comma in an *enum-body*, just like it allows one in an *array-initializer* (§17.7).

## Enum modifiers

An *enum-declaration* may optionally include a sequence of enum modifiers:

```antlr
enum-modifiers:
    enum-modifier
    enum-modifiers enum-modifier

enum-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
```

It is a compile-time error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in an enum declaration.

The modifiers of an enum declaration have the same meaning as those of a class declaration (§15.2.2). However, the `abstract`, and `sealed`, and `static` modifiers are not permitted in an enum declaration. Enums cannot be `abstract` and do not permit derivation.

## Enum members

The body of an enum type declaration defines zero or more enum members, which are the named constants of the enum type. No two enum members can have the same name.

```antlr
enum-member-declarations:
    enum-member-declaration
    enum-member-declarations , enum-member-declaration

enum-member-declaration:
    attributesopt identifier
    attributesopt identifier = constant-expression
```

Each enum member has an associated constant value. The type of this value is the underlying type for the containing enum. The constant value for each enum member shall be in the range of the underlying type for the enum. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
enum Color : uint
{
    Red = -1,
    Green = -2,
    Blue = -3
}
```

results in a compile-time error because the constant values -1, -2, and –3 are not in the range of the underlying integral type `uint`. *end example*]

Multiple enum members may share the same associated value. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,

    Max = Blue
}
```

shows an enum in which two enum members—`Blue` and `Max`—have the same associated value. *end example*]

The associated value of an enum member is assigned either implicitly or explicitly. If the declaration of the enum member has a *constant-expression* initializer, the value of that constant expression, implicitly converted to the underlying type of the enum, is the associated value of the enum member. If the declaration of the enum member has no initializer, its associated value is set implicitly, as follows:

- If the enum member is the first enum member declared in the enum type, its associated value is zero.
- Otherwise, the associated value of the enum member is obtained by increasing the associated value of the textually preceding enum member by one. This increased value shall be within the range of values that can be represented by the underlying type, otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green = 10,
    Blue
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine (StringFromColor (Color.Red));
        Console.WriteLine (StringFromColor (Color.Green));
        Console.WriteLine (StringFromColor (Color.Blue));
    }

    static string StringFromColor (Color c)
    {
        switch (c)
        {
            case Color.Red:
                return String.Format ("Red = {0}", (int) c);

            case Color.Green:
                return String.Format ("Green = {0}", (int) c);

            case Color.Blue:
                return String.Format ("Blue = {0}", (int) c);

            default:
                return "Invalid color";
        }
    }
}
```

prints out the enum member names and their associated values. The output is:

```plaintext
Red = 0
Green = 10
Blue = 11
```

for the following reasons:

- the enum member `Red` is automatically assigned the value zero (since it has no initializer and is the first enum member);
- the enum member `Green` is explicitly given the value 10;
- and the enum member `Blue` is automatically assigned the value one greater than the member that textually precedes it.

*end example*]

The associated value of an enum member may not, directly or indirectly, use the value of its own associated enum member. Other than this circularity restriction, enum member initializers may freely refer to other enum member initializers, regardless of their textual position. Within an enum member initializer, values of other enum members are always treated as having the type of their underlying type, so that casts are not necessary when referring to other enum members.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
enum Circular
{
    A = B,
    B
}
```

results in a compile-time error because the declarations of `A` and `B` are circular. `A` depends on `B` explicitly, and `B` depends on `A` implicitly. *end example*]

Enum members are named and scoped in a manner exactly analogous to fields within classes. The scope of an enum member is the body of its containing enum type. Within that scope, enum members can be referred to by their simple name. From all other code, the name of an enum member shall be qualified with the name of its enum type. Enum members do not have any declared accessibility—an enum member is accessible if its containing enum type is accessible.

## The System.Enum type

The type `System.Enum` is the abstract base class of all enum types (this is distinct and different from the underlying type of the enum type), and the members inherited from `System.Enum` are available in any enum type. A boxing conversion (§11.2.8) exists from any enum type to `System.Enum`, and an unboxing conversion (§11.3.6) exists from `System.Enum` to any enum type.

Note that `System.Enum` is not itself an *enum-type*. Rather, it is a *class-type* from which all *enum-type*s are derived. The type `System.Enum` inherits from the type `System.ValueType` (§9.3.2), which, in turn, inherits from type `object`. At run-time, a value of type `System.Enum` can be `null` or a reference to a boxed value of any enum type.

## Enum values and operations

Each enum type defines a distinct type; an explicit enumeration conversion (§11.3.3) is required to convert between an enum type and an integral type, or between two enum types. The set of values of the enum type is the same as the set of values of the underlying type and is not restricted to the values of the named constants. Any value of the underlying type of an enum can be cast to the enum type, and is a distinct valid value of that enum type.

Enum members have the type of their containing enum type (except within other enum member initializers: see §19.4). The value of an enum member declared in enum type `E` with associated value `v` is `(E)v`.

The following operators can be used on values of enum types:

- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (§12.11.6)
- binary `+` (§12.9.5)
- binary `-` (§12.9.6)
- `^`, `&`, `|` (§12.12.3)
- `~` (§12.8.5)
- `++`, `--` (§12.7.10 and §12.8.6)
- `sizeof` (§23.6.9)

Every enum type automatically derives from the class `System.Enum` (which, in turn, derives from `System.ValueType` and `object`). Thus, inherited methods and properties of this class can be used on values of an enum type.

# Delegates

## General

A delegate declaration defines a class that is derived from the class `System.Delegate`. A delegate instance encapsulates an ***invocation list***, which is a list of one or more methods, each of which is referred to as a ***callable entity***. For instance methods, a callable entity consists of an instance and a method on that instance. For static methods, a callable entity consists of just a method. Invoking a delegate instance with an appropriate set of arguments causes each of the delegate’s callable entities to be invoked with the given set of arguments.

> [!NOTE]
> An interesting and useful property of a delegate instance is that it does not know or care about the classes of the methods it encapsulates; all that matters is that those methods be compatible (§20.4) with the delegate’s type. This makes delegates perfectly suited for “anonymous” invocation.

## Delegate declarations

A *delegate-declaration* is a *type-declaration* (§14.7) that declares a new delegate type.

```antlr
delegate-declaration:
    attributesopt delegate-modifiersopt delegate return-type
    identifier variant-type-parameter-listopt
    ( formal-parameter-listopt ) type-parameter-constraints-clausesopt ;

delegate-modifiers:
    delegate-modifier
    delegate-modifiers delegate-modifier

delegate-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
```

It is a compile-time error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in a delegate declaration.

A delegate declaration shall not supply a *type-parameter-constraints-clauses* unless it also supplies a *variant-type-parameter-list*.

A delegate declaration that supplies a *variant-type-parameter-list* is a generic delegate declaration.

The `new` modifier is only permitted on delegates declared within another type, in which case it specifies that such a delegate hides an inherited member by the same name, as described in §15.3.5.

The `public`, `protected`, `internal`, and `private` modifiers control the accessibility of the delegate type. Depending on the context in which the delegate declaration occurs, some of these modifiers might not be permitted (§8.5.2).

The delegate’s type name is *identifier*.

The optional *formal-parameter-list* specifies the parameters of the delegate, and *return-type* indicates the return type of the delegate.

The optional *variant-type-parameter-list* (§18.2.3) specifies the type parameters to the delegate itself.

The return type of a delegate type shall be either `void`, or output-safe (§18.2.3.2).

All the formal parameter types of a delegate type shall be input-safe. In addition, any `out` or `ref` parameter types shall also be output-safe. 

> [!NOTE]
> Even `out` parameters are required to be input-safe, due to common implementation restrictions.

Delegate types in C# are name equivalent, not structurally equivalent.

[*Example*:

```csharp
delegate int D1(int i, double d);
delegate int D2(int c, double d);
```

The delegate types `D1` and `D2` are two different types, so they are not interchangeable, despite their identical signatures. *end example*]

Like other generic type declarations, type arguments shall be given to create a constructed delegate type. The parameter types and return type of a constructed delegate type are created by substituting, for each type parameter in the delegate declaration, the corresponding type argument of the constructed delegate type.

The only way to declare a delegate type is via a *delegate-declaration*. Every delegate type is a reference type that is derived from `System.Delegate`. The members required for every delegate type are detailed in §20.3. Delegate types are implicitly sealed, so it is not permissible to derive any type from a delegate type. It is also not permissible to declare a non-delegate class type deriving from `System.Delegate`. `System.Delegate` is not itself a delegate type; it is a class type from which all delegate types are derived.

## Delegate members

Every delegate type inherits members from the `Delegate` class as described in §15.3.4. In addition, every delegate type must provide a non-generic `Invoke` method whose parameter list matches the *formal-parameter-list* in the delegate declaration, and whose return type matches the *return-type* in the delegate declaration. The `Invoke` method shall be at least as accessible as the containing delegate type. Calling the `Invoke` method on a delegate type is semantically equivalent to using the delegate invocation syntax (§20.6) .

Implementations may define additional members in the delegate type.

Except for instantiation, any operation that can be applied to a class or class instance can also be applied to a delegate class or instance, respectively. In particular, it is possible to access members of the `System.Delegate` type via the usual member access syntax.

## Delegate compatibility

A method or delegate type `M` is ***compatible*** with a delegate type `D` if all of the following are true:

- `D` and `M` have the same number of parameters, and each parameter in `D` has the same `ref` or `out` modifiers as the corresponding parameter in `M`.
- For each value parameter (a parameter with no ref or out modifier), an identity conversion (§11.2.2) or implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7) exists from the parameter type in `D` to the corresponding parameter type in `M`.
- For each `ref` or `out` parameter, the parameter type in `D` is the same as the parameter type in `M`.
- An identity or implicit reference conversion exists from the return type of `M` to the return type of `D`.

This definition of consistency allows covariance in return type and contravariance in parameter types.

[*Example*:

```csharp
delegate int D1 (int i, double d);
delegate int D2 (int c, double d);
delegate object D3 (string s);

class A
{
    public static int M1 (int a, double b) {…}
}

class B
{
    public static int M1 (int f, double g) {…}
    public static void M2 (int k, double l) {…}
    public static int M3 (int g) {…}
    public static void M4 (int g) {…}
    public static object M5 (string s) {…}
    public static int[] M6 (object o) {…}

}
```

The methods `A.M1` and `B.M1` are compatible with both the delegate types `D1` and `D2`, since they have the same return type and parameter list. The methods `B.M2`, `B.M3`, and `B.M4` are incompatible with the delegate types `D1` and `D2`, since they have different return types or parameter lists. The methods `B.M5 `and `B.M6` are both compatible with delegate type `D3`. *end example*]

[*Example*:

```csharp
delegate bool Predicate<T> (T value);

class X
{
    static bool F (int i) {…}

    static bool G (string s) {…}
}
```

The method `X.F` is compatible with the delegate type `Predicate<int>` and the method `X.G` is compatible with the delegate type `Predicate<string>`. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> The intuitive meaning of delegate compatibility is that a method is compatible with a delegate type if every invocation of the delegate could be replaced with an invocation of the method without violating type safety, treating optional parameters and parameter arrays as explicit parameters. For example, in the following code:
> 
> delegate void Action<T> (T arg);
> 
> class Test
> {
>     static void Print (object value)
>     {
>         Console.WriteLine (value);
>     }
> 
>     static void Main()
>     {
>         Action<string> log = Print;
>         log ("text");
>     }
> }
> 
> The `Print` method is compatible with the `Action<string>` delegate type because any invocation of an `Action<string>` delegate would also be a valid invocation of the `Print` method.
> 
> If the signature of the `Print` method above were changed to `Print(object value, bool prependTimestamp = false)` for example, the `Print` method would no longer be compatible with `Action<string>` by the rules of this clause. 

## Delegate instantiation

An instance of a delegate is created by a *delegate-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.6), a conversion to a delegate type, delegate combination or delegate removal. The newly created delegate instance then refers to one or more of:

- The static method referenced in the *delegate-creation-expression*, or
- The target object (which cannot be null) and instance method referenced in the *delegate-creation-expression*, or
- Another delegate (§12.7.11.6).

[*Example*:

```csharp
delegate void D (int x);
class C
{
    public static void M1 (int i) {…}
    public void M2 (int i) {…}
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        D cd1 = new D (C.M1); // static method
        C t = new C ();
        D cd2 = new D (t.M2); // instance method
        D cd3 = new D (cd2); // another delegate
    }
}
```

*end example*]

The set of methods encapsulated by a delegate instance is called an ***invocation list***. When a delegate instance is created from a single method, it encapsulates that method, and its invocation list contains only one entry. However, when two non-null delegate instances are combined, their invocation lists are concatenated—in the order left operand then right operand—to form a new invocation list, which contains two or more entries.

When a new delegate is created from a single delegate the resultant invocation list has just one entry, which is the source delegate (§12.7.11.6).

Delegates are combined using the binary `+` (§12.9.5) and `+=` operators (§12.18.3). A delegate can be removed from a combination of delegates, using the binary `-` (§12.9.6) and `-=` operators (§12.18.3). Delegates can be compared for equality (§12.11.9).

[*Example*: The following example shows the instantiation of a number of delegates, and their corresponding invocation lists:

```csharp
    delegate void D (int x);
    class C
    {
        public static void M1 (int i) {…}
        public static void M2 (int i) {…}
    }

    class Test
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            D cd1 = new D (C.M1); // M1 - one entry in invocation list

            D cd2 = new D (C.M2); // M2 - one entry

            D cd3 = cd1 + cd2; // M1 + M2 - two entries

            D cd4 = cd3 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M1 - three entries

            D cd5 = cd4 + cd3; // M1 + M2 + M1 + M1 + M2 - five entries

            D td3 = new D (cd3); // [M1 + M2] - ONE entry in invocation

            // list, which is itself a list of two methods.

            D td4 = td3 + cd1; // [M1 + M2] + M1 - two entries

            D cd6 = cd4 - cd2; // M1 + M1 - two entries in invocation list

            D td6 = td4 - cd2; // [M1 + M2] + M1 - two entries in

            // invocation list, but still three methods called, M2 not removed.
        }
    }
```

When `cd1` and `cd2` are instantiated, they each encapsulate one method. When `cd3` is instantiated, it has an invocation list of two methods, `M1` and `M2`, in that order. `cd4`’s invocation list contains `M1`, `M2`, and `M1`, in that order. For `cd5`, the invocation list contains `M1`, `M2`, `M1`, `M1`, and `M2`, in that order.

When creating a delegate from another delegate with a *delegate-creation-expression* the result has an invocation list with a different structure from the original, but which results in the same methods being invoked in the same order. When `td3` is created from `cd3` its invocation list has just one member, but that member is a list of the methods `M1` and `M2` and those methods are invoked by `td3` in the same order as they are invoked by cd3. Similarly when `td4` is instantiated its invocation list has just two entries but it invokes the three methods `M1`, `M2,` and `M1`, in that order just as `cd4` does.

The structure of the invocation list affects delegate subtraction. Delegate cd6, created by subtracting `cd2` (which invokes `M2`) from `cd4` (which invokes `M1`, `M2`, and `M1`) invokes `M1` and `M1`. However delegate `td6`, created by subtracting `cd2` (which invokes `M2`) from `td4` (which invokes `M1`, `M2`, and `M1`) still invokes `M1`, `M2` and `M1`, in that order, as `M2` is not a single entry in the list but a member of a nested list.

For more examples of combining (as well as removing) delegates, see §20.6. *end example*]

Once instantiated, a delegate instance always refers to the same invocation list. 

> [!NOTE]
> Remember, when two delegates are combined, or one is removed from another, a new delegate results with its own invocation list; the invocation lists of the delegates combined or removed remain unchanged.

## Delegate invocation

C# provides special syntax for invoking a delegate. When a non-null delegate instance whose invocation list contains one entry, is invoked, it invokes the one method with the same arguments it was given, and returns the same value as the referred to method. (See §12.7.6.4 for detailed information on delegate invocation.) If an exception occurs during the invocation of such a delegate, and that exception is not caught within the method that was invoked, the search for an exception catch clause continues in the method that called the delegate, as if that method had directly called the method to which that delegate referred.

Invocation of a delegate instance whose invocation list contains multiple entries, proceeds by invoking each of the methods in the invocation list, synchronously, in order. Each method so called is passed the same set of arguments as was given to the delegate instance. If such a delegate invocation includes reference parameters (§15.6.2.3), each method invocation will occur with a reference to the same variable; changes to that variable by one method in the invocation list will be visible to methods further down the invocation list. If the delegate invocation includes output parameters or a return value, their final value will come from the invocation of the last delegate in the list. If an exception occurs during processing of the invocation of such a delegate, and that exception is not caught within the method that was invoked, the search for an exception catch clause continues in the method that called the delegate, and any methods further down the invocation list are not invoked.

Attempting to invoke a delegate instance whose value is `null` results in an exception of type `System.NullReferenceException`.

[*Example*: The following example shows how to instantiate, combine, remove, and invoke delegates:

```csharp
using System;

delegate void D (int x);
class C
{
    public static void M1 (int i)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("C.M1: " + i);
    }

    public static void M2 (int i)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("C.M2: " + i);
    }

    public void M3 (int i)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("C.M3: " + i);
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        D cd1 = new D (C.M1);
        cd1 (-1); // call M1

        D cd2 = new D (C.M2);
        cd2 (-2); // call M2

        D cd3 = cd1 + cd2;
        cd3 (10); // call M1 then M2

        cd3 += cd1;
        cd3 (20); // call M1, M2, then M1

        C c = new C ();
        D cd4 = new D (c.M3);
        cd3 += cd4;
        cd3 (30); // call M1, M2, M1, then M3

        cd3 -= cd1; // remove last M1
        cd3 (40); // call M1, M2, then M3

        cd3 -= cd4;
        cd3 (50); // call M1 then M2

        cd3 -= cd2;
        cd3 (60); // call M1
        cd3 -= cd2; // impossible removal is benign
        cd3 (60); // call M1

        cd3 -= cd1; // invocation list is empty so cd3 is null
        // cd3(70); // System.NullReferenceException thrown
        cd3 -= cd1; // impossible removal is benign
    }
}
```

As shown in the statement `cd3 += cd1`;, a delegate can be present in an invocation list multiple times. In this case, it is simply invoked once per occurrence. In an invocation list such as this, when that delegate is removed, the last occurrence in the invocation list is the one actually removed.

Immediately prior to the execution of the final statement, `cd3 -= cd1`;, the delegate `cd3` refers to an empty invocation list. Attempting to remove a delegate from an empty list (or to remove a non-existent delegate from a non-empty list) is not an error.

The output produced is:

```plaintext
C.M1: -1
C.M2: -2

C.M1: 10
C.M2: 10

C.M1: 20
C.M2: 20
C.M1: 20

C.M1: 30
C.M2: 30
C.M1: 30
C.M3: 30

C.M1: 40
c.M2: 40
C.M3: 40

C.M1: 50
C.M2: 50

C.M1: 60
C.M1: 60
```

# Exceptions

## General

Exceptions in C# provide a structured, uniform, and type-safe way of handling both system level and application-level error conditions.

## Causes of exceptions

Exception can be thrown in two different ways.

- A `throw` statement (§13.10.6) throws an exception immediately and unconditionally. Control never reaches the statement immediately following the throw.
- Certain exceptional conditions that arise during the processing of C# statements and expression cause an exception in certain circumstances when the operation cannot be completed normally. [*Example*: An integer division operation (§12.9.3) throws a `System.DivideByZeroException` if the denominator is zero. *end example*] See §21.5 for a list of the various exceptions that can occur in this way.

## The System.Exception class

The `System.Exception` class is the base type of all exceptions. This class has a few notable properties that all exceptions share:

- `Message` is a read-only property of type string that contains a human-readable description of the reason for the exception.
- `InnerException` is a read-only property of type `Exception`. If its value is non-null, it refers to the exception that caused the current exception. (That is, the current exception was raised in a catch block handling the `InnerException`.) Otherwise, its value is `null`, indicating that this exception was not caused by another exception. The number of exception objects chained together in this manner can be arbitrary.

The value of these properties can be specified in calls to the instance constructor for `System.Exception`.

## How exceptions are handled

Exceptions are handled by a `try` statement (§13.11).

When an exception occurs, the system searches for the nearest catch clause that can handle the exception, as determined by the run-time type of the exception. First, the current method is searched for a lexically enclosing `try` statement, and the associated `catch` clauses of the `try` statement are considered in order. If that fails, the method that called the current method is searched for a lexically enclosing `try` statement that encloses the point of the call to the current method. This search continues until a `catch` clause is found that can handle the current exception, by naming an exception class that is of the same class, or a base class, of the run-time type of the exception being thrown. A cat`ch clause that doesn’t name an exception class can handle any exception.

Once a matching catch clause is found, the system prepares to transfer control to the first statement of the catch clause. Before execution of the catch clause begins, the system first executes, in order, any finally clauses that were associated with try statements more nested that than the one that caught the exception.

If no matching catch clause is found:

- If the search for a matching catch clause reaches a static constructor (§15.12) or static field initializer, then a `System.TypeInitializationException` is thrown at the point that triggered the invocation of the static constructor. The inner exception of the `System.TypeInitializationException` contains the exception that was originally thrown.
- Otherwise, if an exception occurs during finalizer execution, and that exception is not caught, then the behavior is unspecified.
- Otherwise, if the search for matching catch clauses reaches the code that initially started the thread, then execution of the thread is terminated. The impact of such termination is implementation-defined.

## Common exception classes

The following exceptions are thrown by certain C# operations.

|                                      |                                                                                                                                            |
|  ------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  `System.ArithmeticException`          | A base class for exceptions that occur during arithmetic operations, such as `System.DivideByZeroException` and `System.OverflowException`.    |
|  `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException`   | Thrown when a store into an array fails because the type of the stored element is incompatible with the type of the array.                 |
|  `System.DivideByZeroException`        | Thrown when an attempt to divide an integral value by zero occurs.                                                                         |
|  `System.IndexOutOfRangeException`     | Thrown when an attempt to index an array via an index that is less than zero or outside the bounds of the array.                           |
|  `System.InvalidCastException`         | Thrown when an explicit conversion from a base type or interface to a derived type fails at run-time.                                      |
|  `System.NullReferenceException`       | Thrown when a null reference is used in a way that causes the referenced object to be required.                                            |
|  `System.OutOfMemoryException`         | Thrown when an attempt to allocate memory (via `new`) fails.                                                                                 |
|  `System.OverflowException`            | Thrown when an arithmetic operation in a checked context overflows.                                                                        |
|  `System.StackOverflowException`       | Thrown when the execution stack is exhausted by having too many pending calls; typically indicative of very deep or unbounded recursion.   |
|  `System.TypeInitializationException`  | Thrown when a static constructor or static field initializer throws an exception, and no catch clause exists to catch it.                  |

# Attributes

## General

Much of the C# language enables the programmer to specify declarative information about the entities defined in the program. For example, the accessibility of a method in a class is specified by decorating it with the *method-modifiers* `public`, `protected`, `internal`, and `private`.

C# enables programmers to invent new kinds of declarative information, called ***attributes.*** Programmers can then attach attributes to various program entities, and retrieve attribute information in a run-time environment. [*Note*: For instance, a framework might define a `HelpAttribute` attribute that can be placed on certain program elements (such as classes and methods) to provide a mapping from those program elements to their documentation. *end note*]

Attributes are defined through the declaration of attribute classes (§22.2), which can have positional and named parameters (§22.2.3). Attributes are attached to entities in a C# program using attribute specifications (§22.3), and can be retrieved at run-time as attribute instances (§22.4).

## Attribute classes

### General

A class that derives from the abstract class `System.Attribute`, whether directly or indirectly, is an ***attribute class***. The declaration of an attribute class defines a new kind of attribute that can be placed on program entities. By convention, attribute classes are named with a suffix of `Attribute`. Uses of an attribute may either include or omit this suffix.

A generic class declaration shall not use `System.Attribute` as a direct or indirect base class. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

public class B : Attribute { }

public class C<T> : B { } // Error – generic cannot be an attribute
```

*end example*]

### Attribute usage

The attribute `AttributeUsage` (§22.5.2) is used to describe how an attribute class can be used.

`AttributeUsage` has a positional parameter (§22.2.3) that enables an attribute class to specify the kinds of program entities on which it can be used. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Interface)]
public class SimpleAttribute : Attribute {…}
```

defines an attribute class named SimpleAttribute that can be placed on *class-declaration*s and *interface-declaration*s only. The example

```csharp
[Simple] class Class1 {…}

[Simple] interface Interface1 {…}
```

shows several uses of the `Simple` attribute. Although this attribute is defined with the name `SimpleAttribute`, when this attribute is used, the `Attribute` suffix may be omitted, resulting in the short name `Simple`. Thus, the example above is semantically equivalent to the following

```csharp
[SimpleAttribute] class Class1 {…}

[SimpleAttribute] interface Interface1 {…}
```

*end example*]

`AttributeUsage` has a named parameter (§22.2.3), called `AllowMultiple`, which indicates whether the attribute can be specified more than once for a given entity. If `AllowMultiple` for an attribute class is true, then that attribute class is a ***multi-use attribute class***, and can be specified more than once on an entity. If `AllowMultiple` for an attribute class is false or it is unspecified, then that attribute class is a ***single-use attribute class***, and can be specified at most once on an entity.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]
public class AuthorAttribute : Attribute
{
    private string name;

    public AuthorAttribute (string name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
    }
}
```

defines a multi-use attribute class named `AuthorAttribute`. The example

```csharp
[Author("Brian Kernighan"), Author("Dennis Ritchie")]
class Class1 {…}
```

shows a class declaration with two uses of the `Author` attribute. *end example*]

`AttributeUsage` has another named parameter (§22.2.3), called `Inherited`, which indicates whether the attribute, when specified on a base class, is also inherited by classes that derive from that base class. If `Inherited` for an attribute class is true, then that attribute is inherited. If `Inherited` for an attribute class is false then that attribute is not inherited. If it is unspecified, its default value is true.

An attribute class X not having an `AttributeUsage` attribute attached to it, as in

```csharp
using System;

class X: Attribute { … }
```

is equivalent to the following:

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (
    AttributeTargets.All,
    AllowMultiple = false,
    Inherited = true)]
class X : Attribute {…}
```

### Positional and named parameters

Attribute classes can have ***positional parameters*** and ***named parameters***. Each public instance constructor for an attribute class defines a valid sequence of positional parameters for that attribute class. Each non-static public read-write field and property for an attribute class defines a named parameter for the attribute class. Both accessors of a property need to be public for the property to define a named parameter.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Class)]
public class HelpAttribute : Attribute
{

    public HelpAttribute (string url)
    { // url is a positional parameter
        …
    }

    public string Topic
    { // Topic is a named parameter
        get {…}
        set {…}
    }

    public string Url { get {…} }
}
```

defines an attribute class named `HelpAttribute` that has one positional parameter, `url`, and one named parameter, `Topic`. Although it is non-static and public, the property `Url` does not define a named parameter, since it is not read-write.

This attribute class might be used as follows:

```csharp
[Help ("http://www.mycompany.com/…/Class1.htm")]
class Class1
{ }

[Help ("http://www.mycompany.com/…/Misc.htm", Topic = "Class2")]
class Class2
{ }
```

*end example*]

### Attribute parameter types

The types of positional and named parameters for an attribute class are limited to the ***attribute parameter types***, which are:

- One of the following types: `bool`, `byte`, `char`, `double`, `float`, `int`, `long`, `sbyte`, `short`, `string`, `uint`, `ulong`, `ushort`.
- The type `object`.
- The type `System.Type`.
- Enum types.
- Single-dimensional arrays of the above types.

A constructor argument or public field that does not have one of these types, shall not be used as a positional or named parameter in an attribute specification.

## Attribute specification

***Attribute specification*** is the application of a previously defined attribute to a program entity. An attribute is a piece of additional declarative information that is specified for a program entity. Attributes can be specified at global scope (to specify attributes on the containing assembly or module) and for *type-declaration*s (§14.7), *class-member-declaration*s (§15.3), *interface-member-declaration*s (§18.4), *struct-member-declaration*s (§16.3), *enum-member-declaration*s (§19.2), *accessor-declaration*s (§15.7.3), *event-accessor-declaration*s (§15.8), elements of *formal-parameter-list*s (§15.6.2), and elements of *type-parameter-list*s (§15.2.3).

Attributes are specified in ***attribute sections***. An attribute section consists of a pair of square brackets, which surround a comma-separated list of one or more attributes. The order in which attributes are specified in such a list, and the order in which sections attached to the same program entity are arranged, is not significant. For instance, the attribute specifications `[A][B]`, `[B][A]`, `[A, B]`, and `[B, A]` are equivalent.

```antlr
global-attributes:
    global-attribute-sections

global-attribute-sections:
    global-attribute-section
    global-attribute-sections global-attribute-section

global-attribute-section:
    [ global-attribute-target-specifier attribute-list ]
    [ global-attribute-target-specifier attribute-list , ]

global-attribute-target-specifier:
    global-attribute-target :

global-attribute-target:
    identifier equal to assembly or module

attributes:
    attribute-sections

attribute-sections:
    attribute-section
    attribute-sections attribute-section

attribute-section:
    [ attribute-target-specifieropt attribute-list ]
    [ attribute-target-specifieropt attribute-list , ]

attribute-target-specifier:
    attribute-target :

attribute-target:
    identifier not equal to assembly or module
    keyword

attribute-list:
    attribute
    attribute-list , attribute

attribute:
    attribute-name attribute-argumentsopt

attribute-name:
    type-name

attribute-arguments:
    ( positional-argument-listopt )
    ( positional-argument-list , named-argument-list )
    ( named-argument-list )

positional-argument-list:
    positional-argument
    positional-argument-list , positional-argument

positional-argument:
    argument-nameopt attribute-argument-expression

named-argument-list:
    named-argument
    named-argument-list , named-argument

named-argument:
    identifier = attribute-argument-expression

attribute-argument-expression:
    expression
```

For the above productions *global-attribute-target* and *attribute-target*, and in the text below, the referenced equality is that defined in §7.4.3.

An attribute consists of an *attribute-name* and an optional list of positional and named arguments. The positional arguments (if any) precede the named arguments. A positional argument consists of an *attribute-argument-expression*; a named argument consists of a name, followed by an equal sign, followed by an *attribute-argument-expression*, which, together, are constrained by the same rules as simple assignment. The order of named arguments is not significant.

> [!NOTE]
> For convenience, a trailing comma is allowed in a *global-attribute-section* and an *attribute-section*, just as one is allowed in an *array-initializer* (§17.7). 

The *attribute-name* identifies an attribute class.

When an attribute is placed at the global level, a *global-attribute-target-specifier* is required. When the *global-attribute-target* is equal to:

- `assembly` – the target is the containing assembly
- `module` – the target is the containing module

No other values for *global-attribute-target* are allowed.

The standardized *attribute-target* names are `event`, `field`, `method`, `param`, `property`, `return`, `type`, and `typevar`. These target names shall only be used in the following contexts:

- `event` — an event.
- `field` — a field. A field-like event (i.e., one without accessors) can also have an attribute with this target.
- `method` — a constructor, finalizer, method, operator, property get and set accessors, indexer get and set accessors, and event add and remove accessors. A field-like event (i.e., one without accessors) can also have an attribute with this target.
- `param` — a property set accessor, an indexer set accessor, event add and remove accessors, and a parameter in a constructor, method, and operator.
- `property` — a property and an indexer.
- `return` — a delegate, method, operator, property get accessor, and indexer get accessor.
- `type` — a delegate, class, struct, enum, and interface.
- `typevar` — a type parameter.

Certain contexts permit the specification of an attribute on more than one target. A program can explicitly specify the target by including an *attribute-target-specifier*. Without an *attribute-target-specifier* a default is applied, but an *attribute-target-specifier* can be used to affirm or override the default. The contexts are resolved as follows:

- For an attribute on a delegate declaration the default target is the delegate. Otherwise when the attribute-target is equal to:
  - `type` — the target is the delegate
  - `return` — the target is the return value
- For an attribute on a method declaration the default target is the method. Otherwise when the *attribute-target* is equal to:
  - `method` — the target is the method
  - `return` — the target is the return value
- For an attribute on an operator declaration the default target is the operator. Otherwise when the *attribute-target* is equal to:
  - `method` — the target is the operator
  - `return` — the target is the return value
- For an attribute on a get accessor declaration for a property or indexer declaration the default target is the associated method. Otherwise when the *attribute-target* is equal to:
  - `method` — the target is the associated method
  - `return` — the target is the return value
- For an attribute specified on a set accessor for a property or indexer declaration the default target is the associated method. Otherwise when the *attribute-target* is equal to:
  - `method` — the target is the associated method
  - `param` — the target is the lone implicit parameter
- For an attribute specified on an event declaration that omits event-accessor-declarations the default target is the event declaration. Otherwise when the *attribute-target* is equal to:
  - `event` — the target is the event declaration
  - `field` — the target is the field
  - `method` — the targets are the methods
- In the case of an event declaration that does not omit event-accessor-declarations the default target is the method.
  - `method` — the target is the associated method
  - `param` — the target is the lone parameter

In all other contexts, inclusion of an *attribute-target-specifier* is permitted but unnecessary. [*Example*: a class declaration may either include or omit the specifier type:

```csharp
[type : Author ("Brian Kernighan")]
class Class1 { }

[Author ("Dennis Ritchie")]
class Class2 { }
```

*end example*.]

An implementation can accept other *attribute-target*s, the purposes of which are implementation defined. An implementation that does not recognize such an *attribute-target* shall issue a warning and ignore the containing *attribute-section*.

By convention, attribute classes are named with a suffix of `Attribute`. An *attribute-name* can either include or omit this suffix. Specifically, an *attribute-name* is resolved as follows:

- If the right-most identifier of the *attribute-name* is a verbatim identifier (§7.4.3), then the *attribute-name* is resolved as a *type-name* (§8.8). If the result is not a type derived from `System.Attribute`, a compile-time error occurs.
- Otherwise,
  - The *attribute-name* is resolved as a *type-name* (§8.8) except any errors are suppressed. If this resolution is successful and results in a type derived from `System.Attribute` then the type is the result of this step.
  - The characters Attribute are appended to the right-most identifier in the *attribute-name* and the resulting string of tokens is resolved as a *type-name* (§8.8) except any errors are suppressed. If this resolution is successful and results in a type derived from `System.Attribute` then the type is the result of this step.

If exactly one of the two steps above results in a type derived from `System.Attribute`, then that type is the result of the *attribute-name*. Otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

[*Example*: If an attribute class is found both with and without this suffix, an ambiguity is present, and a compile-time error results. If the *attribute-name* is spelled such that its right-most *identifier* is a verbatim identifier (§7.4.3), then only an attribute without a suffix is matched, thus enabling such an ambiguity to be resolved. The example

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.All)]
public class Example : Attribute { }

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.All)]
public class ExampleAttribute : Attribute { }

[Example] // Error: ambiguity
class Class1 { }

[ExampleAttribute] // Refers to ExampleAttribute
class Class2 { }

[@Example] // Refers to Example
class Class3 { }

[@ExampleAttribute] // Refers to ExampleAttribute
class Class4 { }
```

shows two attribute classes named Example and `ExampleAttribute`. The attribute `[Example]` is ambiguous, since it could refer to either `Example` or `ExampleAttribute`. Using a verbatim identifier allows the exact intent to be specified in such rare cases. The attribute `[ExampleAttribute]` is not ambiguous (although it would be if there was an attribute class named `ExampleAttributeAttribute`!). If the declaration for class `Example` is removed, then both attributes refer to the attribute class named `ExampleAttribute`, as follows:

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.All)]
public class ExampleAttribute : Attribute { }

[Example] // Refers to ExampleAttribute
class Class1 { }

[ExampleAttribute] // Refers to ExampleAttribute
class Class2 { }

[@Example] // Error: no attribute named “Example”
class Class3 { }
```

*end example*]

It is a compile-time error to use a single-use attribute class more than once on the same entity. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Class)]
public class HelpStringAttribute : Attribute
{
    string value;

    public HelpStringAttribute (string value)
    {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public string Value { get {…} }
}

[HelpString ("Description of Class1")]
[HelpString ("Another description of Class1")]
public class Class1 { }
```

results in a compile-time error because it attempts to use `HelpString`, which is a single-use attribute class, more than once on the declaration of `Class1`. *end example*]

An expression `E` is an *attribute-argument-expression* if all of the following statements are true:

- The type of `E` is an attribute parameter type (§22.2.4).
- At compile-time, the value of `E` can be resolved to one of the following:
  - A constant value.
  - A `System.Type` object obtained using a *typeof-expression* (§12.7.12) specifying a non-generic type, a closed constructed type (§9.4.3), or an unbound generic type (§9.4.4), but not an open type (§9.4.3).
  - A single-dimensional array of *attribute-argument-expression*s.

[*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

[AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Field)]
public class TestAttribute : Attribute
{
    public int P1
    {
        get {…}
        set {…}
    }

    public Type P2
    {
        get {…}
        set {…}
    }

    public object P3
    {
        get {…}
        set {…}
    }
}

[Test (P1 = 1234, P3 = new int[] { 1, 3, 5 }, P2 = typeof (float))]
class MyClass { }

class C<T>
{
    [Test (P2 = typeof (T))] // Error – T not a closed type.
    int x1;

    [Test (P2 = typeof (C<T>))] // Error – C<T> not a closed type.
    int x2;

    [Test (P2 = typeof (C<int>))] // Ok
    int x3;

    [Test (P2 = typeof (C<>))] // Ok
    int x4;
}
```

*end example*]

The attributes of a type declared in multiple parts are determined by combining, in an unspecified order, the attributes of each of its parts. If the same attribute is placed on multiple parts, it is equivalent to specifying that attribute multiple times on the type. [*Example*: The two parts:

```csharp
[Attr1, Attr2 ("hello")]
partial class A { }

[Attr3, Attr2 ("goodbye")]
partial class A { }
```

are equivalent to the following single declaration:

```csharp
[Attr1, Attr2 ("hello"), Attr3, Attr2 ("goodbye")]
class A { }
```

*end example*]

Attributes on type parameters combine in the same way.

## Attribute instances

### General

An ***attribute instance*** is an instance that represents an attribute at run-time. An attribute is defined with an attribute class, positional arguments, and named arguments. An attribute instance is an instance of the attribute class that is initialized with the positional and named arguments.

Retrieval of an attribute instance involves both compile-time and run-time processing, as described in the following subclauses.

### Compilation of an attribute

The compilation of an *attribute* with attribute class `T`, *positional-argument-list *P, *named-argument-list* `N`, and specified on a program entity `E` is compiled into an assembly `A` via the following steps:

- Follow the compile-time processing steps for compiling an *object-creation-expression* of the form new `T(P)`. These steps either result in a compile-time error, or determine an instance constructor `C` on `T` that can be invoked at run-time.
- If `C` does not have public accessibility, then a compile-time error occurs.
- For each *named-argument* `Arg` in `N`:
  - Let `Name` be the *identifier* of the *named-argument* `Arg`.
  - `Name` shall identify a non-static read-write public field or property on `T`. If `T` has no such field or property, then a compile-time error occurs.
- If any of the values within *positional-argument-list* P or one of the values within *named-argument-list* `N` is of type `System.String` and the value is not well-formed as defined by the Unicode Standard, it is implementation-defined whether the value compiled is equal to the run-time value retrieved (§22.4.3). 
  > [!NOTE]
  > As an example, a string which contains a high surrogate UTF-16 code unit which isn't immediately followed by a low surrogate code unit is not well-formed.
- Store the following information (for run-time instantiation of the attribute) in the assembly output by the compiler as a result of compiling the program containing the attribute: the attribute class `T`, the instance constructor `C` on `T`, the *positional-argument-list *P, the *named-argument-list* `N`, and the associated program entity `E`, with the values resolved completely at compile-time.

### Run-time retrieval of an attribute instance

The attribute instance represented by `T`, `C`, `P`, and `N`, and associated with E can be retrieved at run-time from the assembly `A` using the following steps:

- Follow the run-time processing steps for executing an *object-creation-expression* of the form new `T(P)`, using the instance constructor `C` and values as determined at compile-time. These steps either result in an exception, or produce an instance `O` of `T`.
- For each *named-argument* `Arg` in `N`, in order:
  - Let `Name` be the *identifier* of the *named-argument* `Arg`. If Name does not identify a non-static public read-write field or property on `O`, then an exception is thrown.
  - Let `Value` be the result of evaluating the *attribute-argument-expression* of `Arg`.
  - If `Name` identifies a field on `O`, then set this field to `Value`.
  - Otherwise, `Name` identifies a property on `O`. Set this property to `Value`.
  - The result is `O`, an instance of the attribute class `T` that has been initialized with the *positional-argument-list *P and the *named-argument-list* `N`.

> [!NOTE]
> The format for storing `T`, `C`, `P`, `N` (and associating it with `E`) in `A` and the mechanism to specify `E` and retrieve `T`, `C`, `P`, `N` from `A` (and hence how an attribute instance is obtained at runtime) is beyond the scope of this standard.

[*Example*: In an implementation of the CLI, the `Help` attribute instances in the assembly created by compiling the example program in §22.2.3 can be retrieved with the following program:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;

public sealed class InterrogateHelpUrls
{
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
        Type helpType = typeof (HelpAttribute);
        string assemblyName = args[0];
        foreach (Type t in Assembly.Load (assemblyName).GetTypes ())
        {
            Console.WriteLine ("Type : {0}", t.ToString ());
            HelpAttribute[] helpers =
                (HelpAttribute[]) t.GetCustomAttributes (helpType, false);
            for (int at = 0; at != helpers.Length; at++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine ("\\tUrl : {0}", helpers[at].Url);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

## Reserved attributes

### General

A small number of attributes affect the language in some way. These attributes include:

- `System.AttributeUsageAttribute `(§22.5.2), which is used to describe the ways in which an attribute class can be used.
- `System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute` (§22.5.3), is a multi-use attribute class which is used to define conditional methods and conditional attribute classes. This attribute indicates a condition by testing a conditional compilation symbol.
- `System.ObsoleteAttribute` (§22.5.4), which is used to mark a member as obsolete.
- `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallerLineNumberAttribute` (§22.5.5.2), `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallerFilePathAttribute` (§22.5.5.3), and `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallerMemberNameAttribute` (§22.5.5.4), which are used to supply information about the calling context to optional parameters.

An execution environment may provide additional implementation-specific attributes that affect the execution of a C# program.

### The AttributeUsage attribute

The attribute `AttributeUsage` is used to describe the manner in which the attribute class can be used.

A class that is decorated with the `AttributeUsage` attribute shall derive from `System.Attribute`, either directly or indirectly. Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> For an example of using this attribute, see §22.2.2.

### The Conditional attribute

#### General

The attribute `Conditional` enables the definition of ***conditional methods*** and ***conditional attribute classes***.

#### Conditional methods

A method decorated with the `Conditional` attribute is a conditional method. Each conditional method is thus associated with the conditional compilation symbols declared in its `Conditional` attributes. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
class Eg
{
    [Conditional ("ALPHA")]
    [Conditional ("BETA")]
    public static void M ()
    {
        //…
    }
}
```

declares `Eg.M` as a conditional method associated with the two conditional compilation symbols `ALPHA` and `BETA`. *end example*]

A call to a conditional method is included if one or more of its associated conditional compilation symbols is defined at the point of call, otherwise the call is omitted.

A conditional method is subject to the following restrictions:

- The conditional method shall be a method in a *class-declaration* or *struct-declaration*. A compile-time error occurs if the `Conditional` attribute is specified on a method in an interface declaration.
- The conditional method shall have a return type of `void`.
- The conditional method shall not be marked with the override modifier. A conditional method can be marked with the `virtual` modifier, however. Overrides of such a method are implicitly conditional, and shall not be explicitly marked with a `Conditional` attribute.
- The conditional method shall not be an implementation of an interface method. Otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.
- The parameters of the conditional method shall not have the `out` modifier.

In addition, a compile-time error occurs if a delegate is created from a conditional method.

[*Example*: The example

```csharp
#define DEBUG

using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

class Class1
{
    [Conditional ("DEBUG")]
    public static void M ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Executed Class1.M");
    }
}

class Class2
{
    public static void Test ()
    {
        Class1.M ();
    }
}
```

declares `Class1.M` as a conditional method. `Class2`'s `Test` method calls this method. Since the conditional compilation symbol `DEBUG` is defined, if `Class2.Test` is called, it will call `M`. If the symbol `DEBUG` had not been defined, then `Class2.Test` would not call `Class1.M`. *end example*]

It is important to understand that the inclusion or exclusion of a call to a conditional method is controlled by the conditional compilation symbols at the point of the call. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
// File class1.cs

using System.Diagnostics;

class Class1
{
    [Conditional ("DEBUG")]
    public static void F ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Executed Class1.F");
    }
}

// File class2.cs

#define DEBUG

class Class2
{
    public static void G ()
    {
        Class1.F (); // F is called
    }
}

// File class3.cs

#undef DEBUG

class Class3
{
    public static void H ()
    {
        Class1.F (); // F is not called
    }
}
```

the classes `Class2` and `Class3` each contain calls to the conditional method `Class1.F`, which is conditional based on whether or not `DEBUG` is defined. Since this symbol is defined in the context of `Class2` but not `Class3`, the call to `F` in `Class2` is included, while the call to `F` in `Class3` is omitted. *end example*]

The use of conditional methods in an inheritance chain can be confusing. Calls made to a conditional method through base, of the form `base.`M, are subject to the normal conditional method call rules. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
// File class1.cs

using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

class Class1
{
    [Conditional ("DEBUG")]
    public virtual void M ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Class1.M executed");
    }
}

// File class2.cs

using System;

class Class2 : Class1
{
    public override void M ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Class2.M executed");
        base.M (); // base.M is not called!
    }
}

// File class3.cs

#define DEBUG

using System;

class Class3
{
    public static void Test ()
    {
        Class2 c = new Class2 ();
        c.M (); // M is called
    }
}
```

`Class2` includes a call to the `M` defined in its base class. This call is omitted because the `base` method is conditional based on the presence of the symbol `DEBUG`, which is undefined. Thus, the method writes to the console “`Class2.M executed`” only. Judicious use of *pp-declaration*s can eliminate such problems. *end example*]

#### Conditional attribute classes

An attribute class (§22.2) decorated with one or more `Conditional` attributes is a ***conditional attribute class***. A conditional attribute class is thus associated with the conditional compilation symbols declared in its `Conditional` attributes.

[*Example*:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
[Conditional ("ALPHA")]
[Conditional ("BETA")]
public class TestAttribute : Attribute { }
```

declares `TestAttribute` as a conditional attribute class associated with the conditional compilations symbols `ALPHA` and `BETA`. *end example*]

Attribute specifications (§22.3) of a conditional attribute are included if one or more of its associated conditional compilation symbols is defined at the point of specification, otherwise the attribute specification is omitted.

It is important to note that the inclusion or exclusion of an attribute specification of a conditional attribute class is controlled by the conditional compilation symbols at the point of the specification. [*Example*: In the example

```csharp
// File test.cs:

using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

[Conditional (“DEBUG”)]

public class TestAttribute : Attribute { }

// File class1.cs:

#define DEBUG

[Test] // TestAttribute is specified

class Class1 { }

// File class2.cs:

#undef DEBUG

[Test] // TestAttribute is not specified

class Class2 { }
```

the classes `Class1` and `Class2` are each decorated with attribute `Test`, which is conditional based on whether or not `DEBUG` is defined. Since this symbol is defined in the context of `Class1` but not `Class2`, the specification of the `Test` attribute on `Class1` is included, while the specification of the `Test` attribute on `Class2` is omitted. *end example*]

### The Obsolete attribute

The attribute `Obsolete` is used to mark types and members of types that should no longer be used.

If a program uses a type or member that is decorated with the `Obsolete` attribute, the compiler shall issue a warning or an error. Specifically, the compiler shall issue a warning if no error parameter is provided, or if the error parameter is provided and has the value false. The compiler shall issue an error if the error parameter is specified and has the value true.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
[Obsolete ("This class is obsolete; use class B instead")]
class A
{
    public void F () { }
}

class B
{
    public void F () { }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        A a = new A (); // Warning
        a.F ();
    }
}
```

the class `A` is decorated with the `Obsolete` attribute. Each use of `A` in `Main` results in a warning that includes the specified message, “`This class is obsolete; use class B instead.`” *end example*]

### Caller-info attributes

#### General

For purposes such as logging and reporting, it is sometimes useful for a function member to obtain certain compile-time information about the calling code. The caller-info attributes provide a way to pass such information transparently.

When an optional parameter is annotated with one of the caller-info attributes, omitting the corresponding argument in a call does not necessarily cause the default parameter value to be substituted. Instead, if the specified information about the calling context is available, that information will be passed as the argument value.

[*Example*:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices

…

public void Log (
    [CallerLineNumber] int line = -1, 
    [CallerFilePath] string path = null, 
    [CallerMemberName] string name = null
)
{
    Console.WriteLine ((line < 0) ? "No line" : "Line " + line);
    Console.WriteLine ((path == null) ? "No file path" : path);
    Console.WriteLine ((name == null) ? "No member name" : name);
}
```

A call to `Log()` with no arguments would print the line number and file path of the call, as well as the name of the member within which the call occurred. *end example*]

Caller-info attributes can occur on optional parameters anywhere, including in delegate declarations. However, the specific caller-info attributes have restrictions on the types of the parameters they can attribute, so that there will always be an implicit conversion from a substituted value to the parameter type.

It is an error to have the same caller-info attribute on a parameter of both the defining and implementing part of a partial method declaration. Only caller-info attributes in the defining part are applied, whereas caller-info attributes occurring only in the implementing part are ignored.

Caller information does not affect overload resolution. As the attributed optional parameters are still omitted from the source code of the caller, overload resolution ignores those parameters in the same way it ignores other omitted optional parameters (§12.6.4).

Caller information is only substituted when a function is explicitly invoked in source code. Implicit invocations such as implicit parent constructor calls do not have a source location and will not substitute caller information. Also, calls that are dynamically bound will not substitute caller information. When a caller-info attributed parameter is omitted in such cases, the specified default value of the parameter is used instead.

One exception is query expressions. These are considered syntactic expansions, and if the calls they expand to omit optional parameters with caller-info attributes, caller information will be substituted. The location used is the location of the query clause which the call was generated from.

If more than one caller-info attribute is specified on a given parameter, they are preferred in the following order: `CallerLineNumber`, `CallerFilePath`, `CallerMemberName`.

#### The CallerLineNumber attribute

The `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallerLineNumberAttribute` is allowed on optional parameters when there is a standard implicit conversion (§11.2.2) from the constant value `int.MaxValue` to the parameter’s type. This ensures that any non-negative line number up to that value can be passed without error.

```csharp
namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
{
    [AttributeUsageAttribute (AttributeTargets.Parameter, Inherited = false)]
    public  sealed  class  CallerLineNumberAttribute : Attribute

    {
        public  CallerLineNumberAttribute () {…}
    }
}
```

If a function invocation from a location in source code omits an optional parameter with the `CallerLineNumberAttribute`, then a numeric literal representing that location's line number is used as an argument to the invocation instead of the default parameter value.

If the invocation spans multiple lines, the line chosen is implementation-dependent.

The line number may be affected by `#line` directives (§7.5.8).

#### The CallerFilePath attribute

The `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallerFilePathAttribute `is allowed on optional parameters when there is a standard implicit conversion (§11.2.2) from string to the parameter’s type.

```csharp
namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
{
    [AttributeUsageAttribute (AttributeTargets.Parameter, Inherited = false)]
    public  sealed  class  CallerFilePathAttribute : Attribute

    {
        public  CallerFilePathAttribute () {…}

    }
}
```

If a function invocation from a location in source code omits an optional parameter with the `CallerFilePathAttribute`, then a string literal representing that location's file path is used as an argument to the invocation instead of the default parameter value.

The format of the file path is implementation-dependent.

The file path may be affected by `#line` directives (§7.5.8).

#### The CallerMemberName attribute

The `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallerMemberNameAttribute` is allowed on optional parameters when there is a standard implicit conversion (§11.2.2) from string to the parameter’s type.

```csharp
namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
{
    [AttributeUsageAttribute (AttributeTargets.Parameter, Inherited = false)]
    public  sealed  class  CallerMemberNameAttribute : Attribute

    {
        public  CallerMemberNameAttribute () {…}

    }
}
```

If a function invocation from a location within the body of a function member or within an attribute applied to the function member itself or its return type, parameters or type parameters in source code omits an optional parameter with the `CallerMemberNameAttribute`, then a string literal representing the name of that member is used as an argument to the invocation instead of the default parameter value.

For invocations that occur within generic methods, only the method name itself is used, without the type parameter list.

For invocations that occur within explicit interface member implementations, only the method name itself is used, without the preceding interface qualification.

For invocations that occur within property or event accessors, the member name used is that of the property or event itself.

For invocations that occur within indexer accessors, the member name used is that supplied by an `IndexerNameAttribute` (§) on the indexer member, if present, or the default name `Item` otherwise.

For invocations that occur within field or event initializers, the member name used is the name of the field or event being initialized.

For invocations that occur within declarations of instance constructors, static constructors, finalizers and operators the member name used is implementation-dependent.

## Attributes for interoperation

For interoperation with other languages, an indexer may be implemented using indexed properties. If no `IndexerName` attribute is present for an indexer, then the name `Item` is used by default. The `IndexerName` attribute enables a developer to override this default and specify a different name.

```csharp
namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
{
    [AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Property)]
    public class IndexerNameAttribute : Attribute
    {
        public IndexerNameAttribute (string indexerName) {…}

        public string Value { get {…} }
    }
}
```

# Unsafe code

## General

An implementation that does not support unsafe code is required to diagnose any usage of the keyword unsafe.

**The remainder of this clause, including all of its subclauses, is conditionally normative.**

> [!NOTE]
> The core C# language, as defined in the preceding clauses, differs notably from C and C++ in its omission of pointers as a data type. Instead, C# provides references and the ability to create objects that are managed by a garbage collector. This design, coupled with other features, makes C# a much safer language than C or C++. In the core C# language, it is simply not possible to have an uninitialized variable, a “dangling” pointer, or an expression that indexes an array beyond its bounds. Whole categories of bugs that routinely plague C and C++ programs are thus eliminated.
> 
> While practically every pointer type construct in C or C++ has a reference type counterpart in C#, nonetheless, there are situations where access to pointer types becomes a necessity. For example, interfacing with the underlying operating system, accessing a memory-mapped device, or implementing a time-critical algorithm might not be possible or practical without access to pointers. To address this need, C# provides the ability to write ***unsafe code***.
> 
> In unsafe code, it is possible to declare and operate on pointers, to perform conversions between pointers and integral types, to take the address of variables, and so forth. In a sense, writing unsafe code is much like writing C code within a C# program.
> 
> Unsafe code is in fact a “safe” feature from the perspective of both developers and users. Unsafe code shall be clearly marked with the modifier unsafe, so developers can’t possibly use unsafe features accidentally, and the execution engine works to ensure that unsafe code cannot be executed in an untrusted environment.

## Unsafe contexts

The unsafe features of C# are available only in unsafe contexts. An unsafe context is introduced by including an `unsafe` modifier in the declaration of a type or member, or by employing an *unsafe-statement*:

- A declaration of a class, struct, interface, or delegate may include an unsafe modifier, in which case, the entire textual extent of that type declaration (including the body of the class, struct, or interface) is considered an unsafe context. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > If the *type-declaration* is `partial`, only that part is an unsafe context.
- A declaration of a field, method, property, event, indexer, operator, instance constructor, finalizer, or static constructor may include an `unsafe` modifier, in which case, the entire textual extent of that member declaration is considered an unsafe context.
- An *unsafe-statement* enables the use of an unsafe context within a *block*. The entire textual extent of the associated *block* is considered an unsafe context.

The associated grammar extensions are shown below. For brevity, ellipses (…) are used to represent productions that appear in preceding clauses.

embedded-statement:
    …
    unsafe-statement

```

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public unsafe struct Node
{
    public int Value;
    public Node * Left;
    public Node * Right;
}
```

the `unsafe` modifier specified in the struct declaration causes the entire textual extent of the struct declaration to become an unsafe context. Thus, it is possible to declare the `Left` and `Right` fields to be of a pointer type. The example above could also be written

```csharp
public struct Node
{
    public int Value;
    public unsafe Node* Left;
    public unsafe Node* Right;
}
```

Here, the `unsafe` modifiers in the field declarations cause those declarations to be considered unsafe contexts. *end example*]

Other than establishing an unsafe context, thus permitting the use of pointer types, the `unsafe` modifier has no effect on a type or a member. [*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
public class A
{
    public unsafe virtual void F ()
    {
        char* p;
        …
    }
}

public class B : A
{
    public override void F ()
    {
        base.F ();
        …
    }
}
```

the `unsafe` modifier on the `F` method in `A` simply causes the textual extent of `F` to become an unsafe context in which the unsafe features of the language can be used. In the override of `F` in `B`, there is no need to re-specify the unsafe modifier—unless, of course, the `F` method in `B` itself needs access to unsafe features.

The situation is slightly different when a pointer type is part of the method’s signature

```csharp
public unsafe class A
{
    public virtual void F (char* p) {…}
}

public class B : A
{
    public unsafe override void F (char* p) {…}
}
```

Here, because `F`’s signature includes a pointer type, it can only be written in an unsafe context. However, the unsafe context can be introduced by either making the entire class unsafe, as is the case in `A`, or by including an `unsafe` modifier in the method declaration, as is the case in `B`. *end example*]

When the `unsafe` modifier is used on a `partial` type declaration (§15.2.7), only that particular part is considered an unsafe context.

## Pointer types

In an unsafe context, a *type* (§9) can be a *pointer-type* as well as a *value-type*, a *reference-type*, or a *type-parameter*. In an unsafe context a pointer-type may also be the element type of an array (§17). A pointer-type may also be used in a `typeof` expression (§12.7.12) outside of an unsafe context (as such usage is not unsafe).

```antlr
type:
    …
    pointer-type

non-array-type:
    …
    pointer-type
```

A *pointer-type* is written as an *unmanaged-type* or the keyword void, followed by a * token:

```antlr
pointer-type:
    unmanaged-type 
    void *

unmanaged-type:
    type
```

The type specified before the `*` in a pointer type is called the ***referent type*** of the pointer type. It represents the type of the variable to which a value of the pointer type points.

A *pointer-type* may only be used in an *array-type* in an unsafe context (§23.2). A *non-array-type* is any type that is not itself an *array-type*.

The type specified before the `*` in a pointer type is called the ***referent type*** of the pointer type. It represents the type of the variable to which a value of the pointer type points.

Unlike references (values of reference types), pointers are not tracked by the garbage collector—the garbage collector has no knowledge of pointers and the data to which they point. For this reason a pointer is not permitted to point to a reference or to a struct that contains references, and the referent type of a pointer shall be an *unmanaged-type*.

An *unmanaged-type* is any type that isn’t a *reference-type*, a type-parameter, or a constructed type, and contains no fields whose type is not an unmanaged-type. In other words, an *unmanaged-type* is one of the following:

- `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, or `bool`.
- Any *enum-type*.
- Any *pointer-type*.
- Any user-defined *struct-type* that is not a constructed type and contains fields of *unmanaged-type*s only.

The intuitive rule for mixing of pointers and references is that referents of references (objects) are permitted to contain pointers, but referents of pointers are not permitted to contain references.

[*Example*: Some examples of pointer types are given in the table below:

|  Example    | Description                                   |
|  -----------| --------------------------------------------- |
|  `byte*`      | Pointer to `byte`                               |
|  `char*`      | Pointer to `char`                               |
|  `int**`      | Pointer to pointer to `int`                     |
|  `int*[]`     | Single-dimensional array of pointers to `int`   |
|  `void*`      | Pointer to unknown type                       |

*end example*]

For a given implementation, all pointer types shall have the same size and representation.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike C and C++, when multiple pointers are declared in the same declaration, in C# the `*` is written along with the underlying type only, not as a prefix punctuator on each pointer name. For example:
> 
> ```csharp
> int* pi, pj; // NOT as int *pi, *pj;
> ```

The value of a pointer having type `T*` represents the address of a variable of type `T`. The pointer indirection operator `*` (§23.6.2) can be used to access this variable. [*Example*: Given a variable `P` of type `int*`, the expression `*P` denotes the `int` variable found at the address contained in `P`. *end example*]

Like an object reference, a pointer may be `null`. Applying the indirection operator to a null pointer results in implementation-defined behavior (§23.6.2). A pointer with value `null` is represented by all-bits-zero.

The `void*` type represents a pointer to an unknown type. Because the referent type is unknown, the indirection operator cannot be applied to a pointer of type `void*`, nor can any arithmetic be performed on such a pointer. However, a pointer of type `void*` can be cast to any other pointer type (and vice versa) and compared to values of other pointer types (§23.6.8).

Pointer types are a separate category of types. Unlike reference types and value types, pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object. In particular, boxing and unboxing (§9.3.12) are not supported for pointers. However, conversions are permitted between different pointer types and between pointer types and the integral types. This is described in §23.5.

A *pointer-type* cannot be used as a type argument (§9.4), and type inference (§12.6.3) fails on generic method calls that would have inferred a type argument to be a pointer type.

A *pointer-type* cannot be used as a type of a subexpression of a dynamically bound operation (§12.3.3).

A *pointer-type* may be used as the type of a volatile field (§15.5.4).

> [!NOTE]
> Although pointers can be passed as ref or out parameters, doing so can cause undefined behavior, since the pointer might well be set to point to a local variable that no longer exists when the called method returns, or the fixed object to which it used to point, is no longer fixed. For example:
> 
> ```csharp
> using System;
> 
> class Test
> {
>     static int value = 20;
> 
>     unsafe static void F (out int* pi1, ref int* pi2)
>     {
>         int i = 10;
>         pi1 = & i;
>         fixed (int* pj = & value)
>         {
>             // …
>             pi2 = pj;
>         }
>     }
> 
>     static void Main()
>     {
>         int i = 10;
>         unsafe
>         {
>             int* px1;
>             int* px2 = & i;
>             F (out px1, ref px2);
> 
>             Console.WriteLine ("*px1 = {0}, *px2 = {1}",
>                 *px1, *px2); // undefined behavior
>         }
>     }
> }
> ```

A method can return a value of some type, and that type can be a pointer. [*Example*: When given a pointer to a contiguous sequence of `int`s, that sequence's element count, and some other `int` value, the following method returns the address of that value in that sequence, if a match occurs; otherwise it returns `null`:

```csharp
unsafe static int* Find (int* pi, int size, int value)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
    {
        if ( *pi == value)
            return pi;
        ++pi;
    }
    return null;
}
```

*end example*]

In an unsafe context, several constructs are available for operating on pointers:

- The unary `*` operator may be used to perform pointer indirection (§23.6.2).
- The `->` operator may be used to access a member of a struct through a pointer (§23.6.3).
- The `[]` operator may be used to index a pointer (§23.6.4).
- The unary `&` operator may be used to obtain the address of a variable (§23.6.5).
- The `++` and `--` operators may be used to increment and decrement pointers (§23.6.6).
- The binary `+` and `-` operators may be used to perform pointer arithmetic (§23.6.7).
- The `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators may be used to compare pointers (§23.6.8).
- The `stackalloc` operator may be used to allocate memory from the call stack (§23.9).
- The `fixed` statement may be used to temporarily fix a variable so its address can be obtained (§23.7).

## Fixed and moveable variables

The `address-of` operator (§23.6.5) and the `fixed` statement (§23.7) divide variables into two categories: ***Fixed variables*** and ***moveable variables***.

Fixed variables reside in storage locations that are unaffected by operation of the garbage collector. (Examples of fixed variables include local variables, value parameters, and variables created by dereferencing pointers.) On the other hand, moveable variables reside in storage locations that are subject to relocation or disposal by the garbage collector. (Examples of moveable variables include fields in objects and elements of arrays.)

The `&` operator (§23.6.5) permits the address of a fixed variable to be obtained without restrictions. However, because a moveable variable is subject to relocation or disposal by the garbage collector, the address of a moveable variable can only be obtained using a fixed statement (§23.7), and that address remains valid only for the duration of that fixed statement.

In precise terms, a fixed variable is one of the following:

- A variable resulting from a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) that refers to a local variable, value parameter, or parameter array, unless the variable is captured by an anonymous function (§12.16.6.2).
- A variable resulting from a *member-access* (§12.7.5) of the form `V.I`, where `V` is a fixed variable of a *struct-type*.
- A variable resulting from a *pointer-indirection-expression* (§23.6.2) of the form *P, a *pointer-member-access* (§23.6.3) of the form `P->I`, or a *pointer-element-access* (§23.6.4) of the form `P[E]`.

All other variables are classified as moveable variables.

A static field is classified as a moveable variable. Also, a `ref` or `out` parameter is classified as a moveable variable, even if the argument given for the parameter is a fixed variable. Finally, a variable produced by dereferencing a pointer is always classified as a fixed variable.

## Pointer conversions

### General

In an unsafe context, the set of available implicit conversions (§11.2) is extended to include the following implicit pointer conversions:

- From any *pointer-type* to the type `void*`.
- From the `null` literal (§7.4.5.7) to any *pointer-type*.

Additionally, in an unsafe context, the set of available explicit conversions (§11.3) is extended to include the following explicit pointer conversions:

- From any *pointer-type* to any other *pointer-type*.
- From `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong` to any *pointer-type*.
- From any *pointer-type* to `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong`.

Finally, in an unsafe context, the set of standard implicit conversions (§11.4.2) includes the following pointer conversions:

- From any *pointer-type* to the type `void*`.
- From the `null` literal to any *pointer-type*.

Conversions between two pointer types never change the actual pointer value. In other words, a conversion from one pointer type to another has no effect on the underlying address given by the pointer.

When one pointer type is converted to another, if the resulting pointer is not correctly aligned for the pointed-to type, the behavior is undefined if the result is dereferenced. In general, the concept “correctly aligned” is transitive: if a pointer to type `A` is correctly aligned for a pointer to type `B`, which, in turn, is correctly aligned for a pointer to type `C`, then a pointer to type `A` is correctly aligned for a pointer to type `C`. [*Example*: Consider the following case in which a variable having one type is accessed via a pointer to a different type:

```csharp
char c = 'A';
char* pc = &c;
void* pv = pc;
int* pi = (int*)pv;
int i = *pi; // undefined
*pi = 123456; // undefined
```

*end example*]

When a pointer type is converted to a pointer to `byte`, the result points to the lowest addressed `byte` of the variable. Successive increments of the result, up to the size of the variable, yield pointers to the remaining bytes of that variable. [*Example*: The following method displays each of the eight bytes in a double as a hexadecimal value:

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        double d = 123.456e23;
        unsafe
        {
            byte* pb = (byte* ) & d;
            for (int i = 0; i < sizeof (double); ++i)
                Console.Write ("{0:X2} ", *pb++);
            Console.WriteLine ();
        }
    }
}
```

Of course, the output produced depends on endianness. *end example*]

Mappings between pointers and integers are implementation-defined. 

> [!NOTE]
> However, on 32- and 64-bit CPU architectures with a linear address space, conversions of pointers to or from integral types typically behave exactly like conversions of uint or ulong values, respectively, to or from those integral types.

### Pointer arrays

Arrays of pointers can be constructed using *array-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.5) in an usafe context. Only some of the conversions that apply to other array types are allowed on pointer arrays:

- The implicit reference conversion (§11.2.5) from any *array-type* to `System.Array` and the interfaces it implements also applies to pointer arrays. However, any attempt to access the array elements through `System.Array` or the interfaces it implements may result in an exception at run-time, as pointer types are not convertible to `object`.
- The implicit and explicit reference conversions (§11.2.5, §11.3.4) from a single-dimensional array type `S[]` to `System.Collections.Generic.IList<T>` and its generic base interfaces never apply to pointer arrays.
- The explicit reference conversion (§11.3.4) from `System.Array` and the interfaces it implements to any *array-type* applies to pointer arrays.
- The explicit reference conversions (§11.3.4) from `System.Collections.Generic.IList<S>` and its base interfaces to a single-dimensional array type `T[]` never applies to pointer arrays, since pointer types cannot be used as type arguments, and there are no conversions from pointer types to non-pointer types.

These restrictions mean that the expansion for the `foreach` statement over arrays described in §10.4.4.17 cannot be applied to pointer arrays. Instead, a `foreach` statement of the form

```csharp
foreach (V v in x) *embedded-statement*
```

where the type of `x` is an array type of the form `T[,,…,], *n*` is the number of dimensions minus 1 and `T` or `V` is a pointer type, is expanded using nested for-loops as follows:

```csharp
{
    T[, , …, ] a = x;
    for (int i0 = a.GetLowerBound (0); i0 <= a.GetUpperBound (0); i0++)
        for (int i1 = a.GetLowerBound (1); i1 <= a.GetUpperBound (1); i1++)…
            for (int in = a.GetLowerBound (n); in <= a.GetUpperBound (n); in ++)
            {
                V v = (V) a[i0, i1, …, in ];

                embedded - statement
            }
}
```

The variables `a`, `i0`, `i1`, … `i*n*` are not visible to or accessible to `x` or the *embedded-statement* or any other source code of the program. The variable `v` is read-only in the embedded statement. If there is not an explicit conversion (§23.5) from `T` (the element type) to `V`, an error is produced and no further steps are taken. If `x` has the value `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown at run-time.

> [!NOTE]
> Although pointer types are not permitted as type arguments, pointer arrays may be used as type arguments.

## Pointers in expressions

### General

In an unsafe context, an expression may yield a result of a pointer type, but outside an unsafe context, it is a compile-time error for an expression to be of a pointer type. In precise terms, outside an unsafe context a compile-time error occurs if any *simple-name* (§12.7.3), *member-access* (§12.7.5), *invocation-expression* (§12.7.6), or *element-access* (§12.7.7) is of a pointer type.

In an unsafe context, the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* (§12.7) and *unary-expression* (§12.8) productions permit the following additional constructs:

```antlr
primary-no-array-creation-expression:
    …
    pointer-member-access
    pointer-element-access

unary-expression:
    …
    pointer-indirection-expression
    addressof-expression
```

These constructs are described in the following subclauses.

> [!NOTE]
> The precedence and associativity of the unsafe operators is implied by the grammar.

### Pointer indirection

A *pointer-indirection-expression* consists of an asterisk (`*`)followed by a *unary-expression*.

```antlr
pointer-indirection-expression:
    * unary-expression
```

The unary `*` operator denotes pointer indirection and is used to obtain the variable to which a pointer points. The result of evaluating `*P`, where `P` is an expression of a pointer type `T*`, is a variable of type `T`. It is a compile-time error to apply the unary `*` operator to an expression of type `void*` or to an expression that isn’t of a pointer type.

The effect of applying the unary `*` operator to a `null` pointer is implementation-defined. In particular, there is no guarantee that this operation throws a `System.NullReferenceException`.

If an invalid value has been assigned to the pointer, the behavior of the unary `*` operator is undefined. 

> [!NOTE]
> Among the invalid values for dereferencing a pointer by the unary `*` operator are an address inappropriately aligned for the type pointed to (see example in §23.5), and the address of a variable after the end of its lifetime.

For purposes of definite assignment analysis, a variable produced by evaluating an expression of the form `*P` is considered initially assigned (§10.4.2).

### Pointer member access

A *pointer-member-access* consists of a *primary-expression*, followed by a “`->`” token, followed by an *identifier* and an optional *type-argument-list*.

```antlr
pointer-member-access:
    primary-expression -> identifier type-argument-listopt
```

In a pointer member access of the form `P->I`, `P` shall be an expression of a pointer type, and `I` shall denote an accessible member of the type to which `P` points.

A pointer member access of the form `P->I` is evaluated exactly as `(*P).I`. For a description of the pointer indirection operator (`*`), see §23.6.2. For a description of the member access operator (`.`), see §12.7.5.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

struct Point
{
    public int x;
    public int y;

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return "(" + x + "," + y + ")";
    }
}

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Point point;
        unsafe
        {
            Point* p = &point;
            p->x = 10;
            p->y = 20;
            Console.WriteLine (p->ToString());
        }
    }
}
```

the `->` operator is used to access fields and invoke a method of a struct through a pointer. Because the operation `P->I` is precisely equivalent to `(*P).I`, the `Main` method could equally well have been written:

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Point point;
        unsafe
        {
            Point *p = &point;
            (*p).x = 10;
            (*p).y = 20;
            Console.WriteLine ((*p).ToString());
        }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Pointer element access

A *pointer-element-access* consists of a *primary-no-array-creation-expression* followed by an expression enclosed in “`[`” and “`]`”.

```antlr
pointer-element-access:
    primary-no-array-creation-expression [ expression ]
```

In a pointer element access of the form `P[E]`, `P` shall be an expression of a pointer type other than `void*`, and `E` shall be an expression that can be implicitly converted to `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong`.

A pointer element access of the form `P[E]` is evaluated exactly as `*(P + E)`. For a description of the pointer indirection operator (`*`), see §23.6.2. For a description of the pointer addition operator (`+`), see §23.6.7.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        unsafe
        {
            char* p = stackalloc char[256];
            for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) p[i] = (char) i;
        }
    }
}
```

a pointer element access is used to initialize the character buffer in a `for` loop. Because the operation `P[E]` is precisely equivalent to `*(P + E)`, the example could equally well have been written:

```csharp
class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        unsafe
        {
            char* p = stackalloc char[256];
            for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) *(p + i) = (char) i;
        }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

The pointer element access operator does not check for out-of-bounds errors and the behavior when accessing an out-of-bounds element is undefined. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is the same as C and C++.

### The address-of operator

An *addressof-expression* consists of an ampersand (`&`) followed by a *unary-expression*.

```antlr
addressof-expression:
    & unary-expression
```

Given an expression `E` which is of a type `T` and is classified as a fixed variable (§23.4), the construct `&E` computes the address of the variable given by `E`. The type of the result is `T*` and is classified as a value. A compile-time error occurs if `E` is not classified as a variable, if `E` is classified as a read-only local variable, or if `E` denotes a moveable variable. In the last case, a fixed statement (§23.7) can be used to temporarily “fix” the variable before obtaining its address. 

> [!NOTE]
> As stated in §12.7.5, outside an instance constructor or static constructor for a struct or class that defines a readonly field, that field is considered a value, not a variable. As such, its address cannot be taken. Similarly, the address of a constant cannot be taken.

The `&` operator does not require its argument to be definitely assigned, but following an `&` operation, the variable to which the operator is applied is considered definitely assigned in the execution path in which the operation occurs. It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that correct initialization of the variable actually does take place in this situation.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i;
        unsafe
        {
            int* p = &i;
            *p = 123;
        }
        Console.WriteLine (i);
    }
}
```

`i` is considered definitely assigned following the &i operation used to initialize `p`. The assignment to `*p` in effect initializes `i`, but the inclusion of this initialization is the responsibility of the programmer, and no compile-time error would occur if the assignment was removed. *end example*]

> [!NOTE]
> The rules of definite assignment for the `&` operator exist such that redundant initialization of local variables can be avoided. For example, many external APIs take a pointer to a structure which is filled in by the API. Calls to such APIs typically pass the address of a local struct variable, and without the rule, redundant initialization of the struct variable would be required.

> [!NOTE]
> When a local variable, value parameter, or parameter array is captured by an anonymous function (§12.7.16), that local variable, parameter, or parameter array is no longer considered to be a fixed variable (§23.7), but is instead considered to be a moveable variable. Thus it is an error for any unsafe code to take the address of a local variable, value parameter, or parameter array that has been captured by an anonymous function.

### Pointer increment and decrement

In an unsafe context, the `++` and `--` operators (§12.7.10 and §12.8.6) can be applied to pointer variables of all types except `void*`. Thus, for every pointer type `T*`, the following operators are implicitly defined:

```csharp
T* operator ++(T* x);

T* operator --(T* x);
```

The operators produce the same results as `x+1` and `x-1`, respectively (§23.6.7). In other words, for a pointer variable of type `T*`, the `++` operator adds `sizeof(T)` to the address contained in the variable, and the `--` operator subtracts `sizeof(T)` from the address contained in the variable.

If a pointer increment or decrement operation overflows the domain of the pointer type, the result is implementation-defined, but no exceptions are produced.

### Pointer arithmetic

In an unsafe context, the `+` operator (§12.9.5) and `–` operator (§12.9.6) can be applied to values of all pointer types except `void*`. Thus, for every pointer type `T*`, the following operators are implicitly defined:

```csharp
T* operator +(T* x, int y);
T* operator +(T* x, uint y);
T* operator +(T* x, long y);
T* operator +(T* x, ulong y);

T* operator +(int x, T* y);
T* operator +(uint x, T* y);
T* operator +(long x, T* y);
T* operator +(ulong x, T* y);

T* operator –(T* x, int y);
T* operator –(T* x, uint y);
T* operator –(T* x, long y);
T* operator –(T* x, ulong y);

long operator –(T* x, T* y);
```

Given an expression `P` of a pointer type `T*` and an expression `N` of type `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong`, the expressions `P + N` and `N + P` compute the pointer value of type `T*` that results from adding `N * sizeof(T)` to the address given by `P`. Likewise, the expression `P – N` computes the pointer value of type `T*` that results from subtracting `N * sizeof(T)` from the address given by `P`.

Given two expressions, `P` and `Q`, of a pointer type `T*`, the expression `P – Q` computes the difference between the addresses given by `P` and `Q` and then divides that difference by `sizeof(T)`. The type of the result is always `long`. In effect, `P - Q` is computed as `((long)(P) - (long)(Q)) / sizeof(T)`. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        unsafe
        {
            int* values = stackalloc int[20];

            int* p = &values[1];
            int* q = &values[15];

            Console.WriteLine ("p - q = {0}", p - q);
            Console.WriteLine ("q - p = {0}", q - p);
        }
    }
}
```

which produces the output:

```plaintext
p - q = -14
q - p = 14
```

*end example*]

If a pointer arithmetic operation overflows the domain of the pointer type, the result is truncated in an implementation-defined fashion, but no exceptions are produced.

### Pointer comparison

In an unsafe context, the `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators (§12.11) can be applied to values of all pointer types. The pointer comparison operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(void* x, void* y);
bool operator !=(void* x, void* y);

bool operator <(void* x, void* y);
bool operator >(void* x, void* y);
bool operator <=(void* x, void* y);
bool operator >=(void* x, void* y);
```

Because an implicit conversion exists from any pointer type to the `void*` type, operands of any pointer type can be compared using these operators. The comparison operators compare the addresses given by the two operands as if they were unsigned integers.

### The sizeof operator

For certain predefined types (§12.7.13), the `sizeof` operator yields a constant `int` value. For all other types, the result of the `sizeof` operator is implementation-defined and is classified as a value, not a constant.

The order in which members are packed into a struct is unspecified.

For alignment purposes, there may be unnamed padding at the beginning of a struct, within a struct, and at the end of the struct. The contents of the bits used as padding are indeterminate.

When applied to an operand that has struct type, the result is the total number of bytes in a variable of that type, including any padding.

## The fixed statement

In an unsafe context, the *embedded-statement* (§13.1) production permits an additional construct, the `fixed` statement, which is used to “fix” a moveable variable such that its address remains constant for the duration of the statement.

```antlr
embedded-statement:
    …
    fixed-statement

fixed-statement:
    fixed ( pointer-type fixed-pointer-declarators ) embedded-statement

fixed-pointer-declarators:
    fixed-pointer-declarator
    fixed-pointer-declarators , fixed-pointer-declarator

fixed-pointer-declarator:
    identifier = fixed-pointer-initializer

fixed-pointer-initializer:
    & variable-reference
    expression
```

Each *fixed-pointer-declarator* declares a local variable of the given *pointer-type* and initializes that local variable with the address computed by the corresponding *fixed-pointer-initializer*. A local variable declared in a fixed statement is accessible in any *fixed-pointer-initializer*s occurring to the right of that variable’s declaration, and in the *embedded-statement* of the fixed statement. A local variable declared by a fixed statement is considered read-only. A compile-time error occurs if the embedded statement attempts to modify this local variable (via assignment or the `++` and `--` operators) or pass it as a `ref` or `out` parameter.

It is an error to use a captured local variable (§12.16.6.2), value parameter, or parameter array in a *fixed-pointer-initializer*.A *fixed-pointer-initializer* can be one of the following:

- The token “`&`” followed by a *variable-reference* (§10.5) to a moveable variable (§23.4) of an unmanaged type `T`, provided the type `T*` is implicitly convertible to the pointer type given in the fixed statement. In this case, the initializer computes the address of the given variable, and the variable is guaranteed to remain at a fixed address for the duration of the fixed statement.
- An expression of an *array-type* with elements of an unmanaged type `T`, provided the type `T*` is implicitly convertible to the pointer type given in the fixed statement. In this case, the initializer computes the address of the first element in the array, and the entire array is guaranteed to remain at a fixed address for the duration of the fixed statement. The behavior of the fixed statement is implementation-defined if the array expression is `null` or if the array has zero elements.
- An expression of type string, provided the type `char*` is implicitly convertible to the pointer type given in the fixed statement. In this case, the initializer computes the address of the first character in the string, and the entire string is guaranteed to remain at a fixed address for the duration of the fixed statement. The behavior of the fixed statement is implementation-defined if the string expression is null.
- A *simple-name* or *member-access* that references a fixed-size buffer member of a moveable variable, provided the type of the fixed-size buffer member is implicitly convertible to the pointer type given in the fixed statement. In this case, the initializer computes a pointer to the first element of the fixed-size buffer (§23.8.3), and the fixed-size buffer is guaranteed to remain at a fixed address for the duration of the fixed statement.

For each address computed by a *fixed-pointer-initializer* the fixed statement ensures that the variable referenced by the address is not subject to relocation or disposal by the garbage collector for the duration of the fixed statement. [*Example*: If the address computed by a *fixed-pointer-initializer* references a field of an object or an element of an array instance, the fixed statement guarantees that the containing object instance is not relocated or disposed of during the lifetime of the statement. *end example*]

It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that pointers created by fixed statements do not survive beyond execution of those statements. [*Example*: When pointers created by fixed statements are passed to external APIs, it is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure that the APIs retain no memory of these pointers. *end example*]

Fixed objects can cause fragmentation of the heap (because they can’t be moved). For that reason, objects should be fixed only when absolutely necessary and then only for the shortest amount of time possible. [*Example*: The example

```csharp
class Test
{
    static int x;
    int y;

    unsafe static void F (int* p)
    {
        *p = 1;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Test t = new Test ();
        int[] a = new int[10];
        unsafe
        {
            fixed (int* p = &x) F (p);
            fixed (int* p = &t.y) F (p);
            fixed (int* p = &a[0]) F (p);
            fixed (int* p = a) F (p);
        }
    }
}
```

demonstrates several uses of the fixed statement. The first statement fixes and obtains the address of a static field, the second statement fixes and obtains the address of an instance field, and the third statement fixes and obtains the address of an array element. In each case, it would have been an error to use the regular `&` operator since the variables are all classified as moveable variables.

The third and fourth fixed statements in the example above produce identical results. In general, for an array instance `a`, specifying `&a[0]` in a fixed statement is the same as simply specifying `a`. Here’s another example of the fixed statement, this time using `string`:

```csharp
class Test
{
    static string name = "xx";

    unsafe static void F (char* p)
    {
        for (int i = 0; p[i] != '\\0'; ++i)
            Console.WriteLine (p[i]);
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        unsafe
        {
            fixed (char* p = name) F (p);
            fixed (char* p = "xx") F (p);
        }
    }
}
```

*end example*]

In an unsafe context, array elements of single-dimensional arrays are stored in increasing index order, starting with index 0 and ending with index `Length – 1`. For multi-dimensional arrays, array elements are stored such that the indices of the rightmost dimension are increased first, then the next left dimension, and so on to the left.

Within a fixed statement that obtains a pointer `p` to an array instance `a`, the pointer values ranging from `p` to `p + a.Length - 1` represent addresses of the elements in the array. Likewise, the variables ranging from `p[0]` to `p[a.Length - 1]` represent the actual array elements. Given the way in which arrays are stored, we can treat an array of any dimension as though it were linear. [*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[, , ] a = new int[2, 3, 4];

        unsafe
        {
            fixed (int* p = a)
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; ++i) // treat as linear
                    p[i] = i;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j)
            {
                for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k)
                    Console.Write ("[{0},{1},{2}] = {3,2} ", i, j, k,
                        a[i, j, k]);
                Console.WriteLine ();
            }
    }
}
```

which produces the output:

```plaintext
[0,0,0] = 0 [0,0,1] = 1 [0,0,2] = 2 [0,0,3] = 3
[0,1,0] = 4 [0,1,1] = 5 [0,1,2] = 6 [0,1,3] = 7
[0,2,0] = 8 [0,2,1] = 9 [0,2,2] = 10 [0,2,3] = 11
[1,0,0] = 12 [1,0,1] = 13 [1,0,2] = 14 [1,0,3] = 15
[1,1,0] = 16 [1,1,1] = 17 [1,1,2] = 18 [1,1,3] = 19
[1,2,0] = 20 [1,2,1] = 21 [1,2,2] = 22 [1,2,3] = 23
```

*end example*]

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
    unsafe static void Fill (int* p, int count, int value)
    {
        for (; count != 0; count--) *p++ = value;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        int[] a = new int[100];
        unsafe
        {
            fixed (int* p = a) Fill (p, 100, -1);
        }
    }
}
```

a fixed statement is used to fix an array so its address can be passed to a method that takes a pointer. *end example*]

A `char*` value produced by fixing a string instance always points to a null-terminated string. Within a fixed statement that obtains a pointer `p` to a string instance `s`, the pointer values ranging from `p` to `p + s.Length ‑ 1` represent addresses of the characters in the string, and the pointer value` p + s.Length` always points to a `null` character (the character with value '`\\0`').

Modifying objects of managed type through fixed pointers can result in undefined behavior. 

> [!NOTE]
> For example, because strings are immutable, it is the programmer’s responsibility to ensure that the characters referenced by a pointer to a fixed string are not modified.

> [!NOTE]
> The automatic null-termination of strings is particularly convenient when calling external APIs that expect “C-style” strings. Note, however, that a string instance is permitted to contain `null` characters. If such `null` characters are present, the string will appear truncated when treated as a null-terminated char*.

## Fixed-size buffers

### General

Fixed-size buffers are used to declare “C-style” in-line arrays as members of structs, and are primarily useful for interfacing with unmanaged APIs.

### Fixed-size buffer declarations

A ***fixed-size buffer*** is a member that represents storage for a fixed-length buffer of variables of a given type. A fixed-size buffer declaration introduces one or more fixed-size buffers of a given element type. Fixed-size buffers are only permitted in struct declarations and may only occur in unsafe contexts (§23.2).

```antlr
struct-member-declaration:
    …
    fixed-size-buffer-declaration

fixed-size-buffer-declaration:
    attributesopt fixed-size-buffer-modifiersopt fixed buffer-element-type
    fixed-size-buffer-declarators ;

fixed-size-buffer-modifiers:
    fixed-size-buffer-modifier
    fixed-size-buffer-modifier fixed-size-buffer-modifiers

fixed-size-buffer-modifier:
    new
    public
    protected
    internal
    private
    unsafe

buffer-element-type:
    type

fixed-size-buffer-declarators:
    fixed-size-buffer-declarator
    fixed-size-buffer-declarator , fixed-size-buffer-declarators

fixed-size-buffer-declarator:
    identifier [ constant-expression ]
```

A fixed-size buffer declaration may include a set of attributes (§22), a `new` modifier (§15.3.5), a valid combination of the four access modifiers (§15.3.6) and an `unsafe` modifier (§23.2). The attributes and modifiers apply to all of the members declared by the fixed-size buffer declaration. It is an error for the same modifier to appear multiple times in a fixed-size buffer declaration.

A fixed-size buffer declaration is not permitted to include the `static` modifier.

The buffer element type of a fixed-size buffer declaration specifies the element type of the buffer(s) introduced by the declaration. The buffer element type shall be one of the predefined types `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `char`, `float`, `double`, or `bool`.

The buffer element type is followed by a list of fixed-size buffer declarators, each of which introduces a new member. A fixed-size buffer declarator consists of an identifier that names the member, followed by a constant expression enclosed in `[` and `]` tokens. The constant expression denotes the number of elements in the member introduced by that fixed-size buffer declarator. The type of the constant expression shall be implicitly convertible to type `int`, and the value shall be a non-zero positive integer.

The elements of a fixed-size buffer shall be laid out sequentially in memory.

A fixed-size buffer declaration that declares multiple fixed-size buffers is equivalent to multiple declarations of a single fixed-size buffer declation with the same attributes, and element types. [*Example*:

```csharp
unsafe struct A
{
    public fixed int x[5], y[10], z[100];
}
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
unsafe struct A
{
    public fixed int x[5];
    public fixed int y[10];
    public fixed int z[100];
}
```

*end example*]

### Fixed-size buffers in expressions

Member lookup (§12.5) of a fixed-size buffer member proceeds exactly like member lookup of a field.

A fixed-size buffer can be referenced in an expression using a *simple-name* (§12.6.3) or a *member-access* (§12.6.5).

When a fixed-size buffer member is referenced as a simple name, the effect is the same as a member access of the form `this.I`, where `I` is the fixed-size buffer member.

In a member access of the form `E.I`, if `E` is of a struct type and a member lookup of `I` in that struct type identifies a fixed-size member, then `E.I` is evaluated an classified as follows:

- If the expression `E.I` does not occur in an unsafe context, a compile-time error occurs.
- If `E` is classified as a value, a compile-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, if `E` is a moveable variable (§23.4) and the expression `E.I` is not a *fixed-pointer-initializer* (§23.7), a compile-time error occurs.
- Otherwise, `E` references a fixed variable and the result of the expression is a pointer to the first element of the fixed-size buffer member `I` in `E`. The result is of type `S*`, where `S` is the element type of `I`, and is classified as a value.

The subsequent elements of the fixed-size buffer can be accessed using pointer operations from the first element. Unlike access to arrays, access to the elements of a fixed-size buffer is an unsafe operation and is not range checked.

[*Example*: The following declares and uses a struct with a fixed-size buffer member.

```csharp
unsafe struct Font
{
    public int size;
    public fixed char name[32];
}

class Test
{
    unsafe static void PutString (string s, char* buffer, int bufSize)
    {
        int len = s.Length;
        if (len > bufSize) len = bufSize;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) buffer[i] = s[i];
        for (int i = len; i < bufSize; i++) buffer[i] = (char) 0;
    }

    unsafe static void Main()
    {
        Font f;
        f.size = 10;
        PutString ("Times New Roman", f.name, 32);
    }
}
```

*end example*]

### Definite assignment checking

Fixed-size buffers are not subject to definite assignment-checking (§10.4), and fixed-size buffer members are ignored for purposes of definite-assignment checking of struct type variables.

When the outermost containing struct variable of a fixed-size buffer member is a static variable, an instance variable of a class instance, or an array element, the elements of the fixed-size buffer are automatically initialized to their default values (§10.3). In all other cases, the initial content of a fixed-size buffer is undefined.

## Stack allocation

In an unsafe context, a local variable declaration (§13.6.2) may include a stack allocation initializer, which allocates memory from the call stack.

```antlr
local-variable-initializer:
    …
    stackalloc-initializer

stackalloc-initializer:
    stackalloc unmanaged-type [ expression ]
```

The *unmanaged-type* indicates the type of the items that will be stored in the newly allocated location, and the *expression* indicates the number of these items. Taken together, these specify the required allocation size. Since the size of a stack allocation cannot be negative, it is a compile-time error to specify the number of items as a *constant-expression* that evaluates to a negative value.

A stack allocation initializer of the form `stackalloc T[E]` requires `T` to be an unmanaged type (§23.3) and `E` to be an expression implicitly convertible to type `int`. The construct allocates `E * sizeof(T)` bytes from the call stack and returns a pointer, of type `T*`, to the newly allocated block. If `E` is a negative value, then the behavior is undefined. If `E` is zero, then no allocation is made, and the pointer returned is implementation-defined. If there is not enough memory available to allocate a block of the given size, a `System.StackOverflowException` is thrown.

The content of the newly allocated memory is undefined.

Stack allocation initializers are not permitted in `catch` or `finally` blocks (§13.11).

> [!NOTE]
> There is no way to explicitly free memory allocated using `stackalloc`. 

All stack-allocated memory blocks created during the execution of a function member are automatically discarded when that function member returns. 

> [!NOTE]
> This corresponds to the `alloca` function, an extension commonly found in C and C++ implementations.

[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
    static string IntToString(int value)
    {
        int n = value >= 0 ? value : -value;
        unsafe

```

a `stackalloc` initializer is used in the `IntToString` method to allocate a buffer of 16 characters on the stack. The buffer is automatically discarded when the method returns. *end example*]

Except for the `stackalloc` operator, C# provides no predefined constructs for managing non-garbage collected memory. Such services are typically provided by supporting class libraries or imported directly from the underlying operating system.

# Portability issues

**This clause is informative.**

## General

This annex collects some information about portability that appears in this specification.

## Undefined behavior

The behavior is undefined in the following circumstances:

1.  The behavior of the enclosing async function when an awaiter’s implementation of the interface methods `INotifyCompletion.OnCompleted` and `ICriticalNotifyCompletion.UnsafeOnCompleted` does not cause the resumption delegate to be invoked at most once (§12.8.8.4).
1. Passing pointers as ref or out parameters (§23.3).
1. When dereferencing the result of converting one pointer type to another and the resulting pointer is not correctly aligned for the pointed-to type. (§23.5.1)
1. When the unary `*` operator is applied to a pointer containing an invalid value (§23.6.2).
1. When a pointer is subscripted to access an out-of-bounds element (§23.6.4).
1. Modifying objects of managed type through fixed pointers (§23.7)
1. The content of memory newly allocated by `stackalloc` (§23.9).
1. Attempting to allocate a negative number of items using `stackalloc` (§23.9).

## Implementation-defined behavior

A conforming implementation is required to document its choice of behavior in each of the areas listed in this subclause. The following are implementation-defined:

1.  The behavior when an identifier not in Normalization Form C is encountered (§7.4.3).
1. The interpretation of the *input-characters* in the *pp-pragma-text* of a `#pragma` directive (§7.5.9).
1. The values of any application parameters passed to `Main` by the host environment prior to application startup (§8.1).
1. The precise structure of the expression tree, as well as the exact process for creating it, when an anonymous function is converted to an expression-tree (§11.7.3).
1. Whether a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) is thrown or the overflow goes unreported with the resulting value being that of the left operand, when in an unchecked context and the left operand of an integer division is the maximum negative `int` or `long` value and the right operand is –1 (§12.9.3).
1. When a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) is thrown when performing a decimal remainder operation (§12.9.4).
1. The impact of thread termination when a thread has no handler for an exception, and the thread is itself terminated (§13.10.6).
1. The impact of thread termination when no matching catch clause is found for an exception and the code that initially started that thread is reached. (§21.4)
1. The mappings between pointers and integers (§23.5.1).
1. The effect of applying the unary `*` operator to a null pointer (§23.6.2).
1. The behavior when pointer arithmetic overflows the domain of the pointer type (§23.6.6, §23.6.7).
1. The result of the sizeof operator for non-pre-defined value types (§23.6.9).
1. The behavior of the fixed statement if the array expression is `null` or if the array has zero elements (§23.7).
1. The behavior of the fixed statement if the string expression is `null `(§23.7).
1. The value returned when a stack allocation of size zero is made (§23.9).

## Unspecified behavior

1.  The time at which the finalizer (if any) for an object is run, once that object has become eligible for finalization (§8.9).
1. The value of the result when converting out-of-range values from `float` or `double` values to an integral type in an unchecked context (§11.3.2).
1. The exact target object and target method of the delegate produced from an *anonymous-method-expression* contains (§11.7.2).
1. The layout of arrays, except in an unsafe context (§12.7.11.5).
1. Whether there is any way to execute the *block* of an anonymous function other than through evaluation and invocation of the *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression* (§12.16.3).
1. The exact timing of static field initialization (§15.5.6.2).
1. The result of invoking `MoveNext` when an enumerator object is running (§15.14.5.2).
1. The result of accessing `Current` when an enumerator object is in the before, running, or after states (§15.14.5.3).
1. The result of invoking `Dispose` when an enumerator object is in the running state (§15.14.5.4).
1. The attributes of a type declared in multiple parts are determined by combining, in an unspecified order, the attributes of each of its parts (§22.3).
1. The order in which members are packed into a struct (§23.6.9).
1. An exception occurs during finalizer execution, and that execution is not caught (§21.4).
1. If more than one member matches, which member is the implementation of I.M.(§18.6.5)

## Other Issues

1.  The exact results of floating-point expression evaluation can vary from one implementation to another, because an implementation is permitted to evaluate such expressions using a greater range and/or precision than is required. (§9.3.7)
1.  The CLI reserves certain signatures for compatibility with other programming languages. (§15.3.9.7)

# Standard library

## General 

A conforming C# implementation shall provide a minimum set of types having specific semantics. These types and their members are listed here, in alphabetical order by namespace and type. For a formal definition of these types and their members, refer to ISO/IEC 23271:2012 *Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), Partition IV; Base Class Library (BCL), Extended Numerics Library, and Extended Array Library*, which are included by reference in this specification.

**This text is informative.**

The standard library is intended to be the minimum set of types and members required by a conforming C# implementation. As such, it contains only those members that are explicitly required by the C# language specification.

It is expected that a conforming C# implementation will supply a significantly more extensive library that enables useful programs to be written. For example, a conforming implementation might extend this library by

- Adding namespaces.
- Adding types.
- Adding members to non-interface types.
- Adding intervening base classes or interfaces.
- Having struct and class types implement additional interfaces.
- Adding attributes (other than the `ConditionalAttribute`) to existing types and members.

## Standard Library Types not defined in ISO/IEC 23271:2012

The following types, including the members listed, must be defined in a conforming standard library. (These types might be defined in a future edition of ISO/IEC 23271.) It is expected that many of these types will have more members available than are listed.

A conforming implementation may provide `Task.GetAwaiter()` and `Task<T>.GetAwaiter()` as extension methods.

```csharp
namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
{
    [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Parameter, Inherited = false)]
    
    public sealed class CallerFilePathAttribute : Attribute

    {
    
        public CallerFilePathAttribute() {}

# Documentation comments

**This annex is informative.**

## General

C# provides a mechanism for programmers to document their code using a special comment syntax that contains XML text. In source code files, comments having a certain form can be used to direct a tool to produce XML from those comments and the source code elements, which they precede. Comments using such syntax are called ***documentation comments***. They must immediately precede a user-defined type (such as a class, delegate, or interface) or a member (such as a field, event, property, or method). The XML generation tool is called the ***documentation generator***. (This generator could be, but need not be, the C# compiler itself.) The output produced by the documentation generator is called the ***documentation file***. A documentation file is used as input to a ***documentation viewer***; a tool intended to produce some sort of visual display of type information and its associated documentation.

A conforming C# compiler is not required to check the syntax of documentation comments; such comments are simply ordinary comments. A conforming compiler is permitted to do such checking, however.

This specification suggests a set of standard tags to be used in documentation comments, but use of these tags is not required, and other tags may be used if desired, as long the rules of well-formed XML are followed. For C# implementations targeting the CLI, it also provides information about the documentation generator and the format of the documentation file. No information is provided about the documentation viewer.

## Introduction

Comments having a special form can be used to direct a tool to produce XML from those comments and the source code elements, which they precede. Such comments are single-line comments that start with three slashes (`///`), or delimited comments that start with a slash and two stars (`/**`). They must immediately precede a user-defined type (such as a class, delegate, or interface) or a member (such as a field, event, property, or method) that they annotate. Attribute sections (§22.3) are considered part of declarations, so documentation comments must precede attributes applied to a type or member.

**Syntax:**

```antlr
single-line-doc-comment::
    /// input-charactersopt

delimited-doc-comment::
/** delimited-comment-textopt 
```

In a *single-line-doc-comment*, if there is a *whitespace* character following the `//` characters on each of the *single-line-doc-comments* adjacent to the current *single-line-doc-comment*, then that *whitespace* character is not included in the XML output.

In a *delimited-doc-comment*, if the first non-*whitespace* character on the second line is an *asterisk* and the same pattern of optional *whitespace* characters and an *asterisk* character is repeated at the beginning of each of the lines within the *delimited-doc-comment*, then the characters of the repeated pattern are not included in the XML output. The pattern can include *whitespace* characters after, as well as before, the *asterisk* character.

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>Class <c>Point</c> models a point in a two-dimensional
/// plane.</summary>
///
public class Point
{
/// <summary>method <c>draw</c> renders the point.</summary>
void draw() {…}
}
```

The text within documentation comments must be well formed according to the rules of XML (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml). If the XML is ill formed, a warning is generated and the documentation file will contain a comment saying that an error was encountered.

Although developers are free to create their own set of tags, a recommended set is defined in §D.3. Some of the recommended tags have special meanings:

- The `<param>` tag is used to describe parameters. If such a tag is used, the documentation generator must verify that the specified parameter exists and that all parameters are described in documentation comments. If such verification fails, the documentation generator issues a warning.
- The `cref` attribute can be attached to any tag to provide a reference to a code element. The documentation generator must verify that this code element exists. If the verification fails, the documentation generator issues a warning. When looking for a name described in a `cref` attribute, the documentation generator must respect namespace visibility according to using statements appearing within the source code. For code elements that are generic, the normal generic syntax (e.g.; “`List<T>`”) cannot be used because it produces invalid XML. Braces can be used instead of brackets (e.g.; “List{T}”), or the XML escape syntax can be used (e.g.; “`List<T>`”).
- The `<summary>` tag is intended to be used by a documentation viewer to display additional information about a type or member.
- The `<include>` tag includes information from an external XML file.

Note carefully that the documentation file does not provide full information about the type and members (for example, it does not contain any type information). To get such information about a type or member, the documentation file must be used in conjunction with reflection on the type or member.

## Recommended tags

### General 

The documentation generator must accept and process any tag that is valid according to the rules of XML. The following tags provide commonly used functionality in user documentation. (Of course, other tags are possible.)

|  **Tag**          | **Reference**   | **Purpose**                                                   |
|  -----------------| ----------------| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  <c>              | §D.3.2          | Set text in a code-like font                                  |
|  <code>           | §D.3.3          | Set one or more lines of source code or program output        |
|  <example>        | §D.3.4          | Indicate an example                                           |

|  <include>        | §D.3.6          | Includes XML from an external file                            |
|  <para>           | §D.3.8          | Permit structure to be added to text                          |
|  <param>          | §D.3.9          | Describe a parameter for a method or constructor              |
|  <paramref>       | §D.3.10         | Identify that a word is a parameter name                      |
|  <permission>     | §D.3.11         | Document the security accessibility of a member               |
|  <remarks>        | §D.3.12         | Describe additional information about a type                  |
|  <returns>        | §D.3.13         | Describe the return value of a method                         |

### `<c>`

This tag provides a mechanism to indicate that a fragment of text within a description should be set in a special font such as that used for a block of code. For lines of actual code, use `<code>` (§D.3.3).

**Syntax:**

`<c>text</c>`

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>Class <c>Point</c> models a point in a two-dimensional
/// plane.</summary>

public class Point
{
// …
}
```

### `<code>`

This tag is used to set one or more lines of source code or program output in some special font. For small code fragments in narrative, use `<c>` (§D.3.2).

**Syntax:**

`<code>`*source code or program output*`</code>`

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>This method changes the point's location by
/// the given x- and y-offsets.
/// <example>For example:
/// <code>
/// Point p = new Point(3,5);
/// p.Translate(-1,3);
/// </code>
/// results in <c>p</c>'s having the value (2,8).
/// </example>
/// </summary>

public void Translate(int xor, int yor) {
X += xor;
Y += yor;
}
```

### <example>

This tag allows example code within a comment, to specify how a method or other library member might be used. Ordinarily, this would also involve use of the tag `<code>` (§D.3.3) as well.

**Syntax:**

`<example>`*description*`</example>`

**Example:**

See `<code>` (§D.3.3) for an example.

### `<exception>`

This tag provides a way to document the exceptions a method can throw.

**Syntax:**

`<exception cref="*member*">`*description*`</exception>`

where

```csharp
> cref="member"
>
> The name of a member. The documentation generator checks that the given member exists and translates member to the canonical element name in the documentation file.
>
> description 
>
> A description of the circumstances in which the exception is thrown.
```

**Example:**

```csharp
public class DataBaseOperations
{
/// <exception cref="MasterFileFormatCorruptException"></exception>
/// <exception cref="MasterFileLockedOpenException"></exception>
public static void ReadRecord(int flag) {
if (flag == 1)
throw new MasterFileFormatCorruptException();
else if (flag == 2)
throw new MasterFileLockedOpenException();
// …
}
}
```

### <include>

This tag allows including information from an XML document that is external to the source code file. The external file must be a well-formed XML document, and an XPath expression is applied to that document to specify what XML from that document to include. The `<include>` tag is then replaced with the selected XML from the external document.

**Syntax**:

`<include file="*filename*" path="*xpath*" */>*`

where

```ANTLR
> file="filename"
>
> The file name of an external XML file. The file name is interpreted relative to the file that contains the include tag.
>
> path=*"*xpath*"*
>
> An XPath expression that selects some of the XML in the external XML file.
```

**Example**:

If the source code contained a declaration like:

```csharp
/// <include file="docs.xml" path='extradoc/class[@name="IntList"]/\*' />
public class IntList { … }
```

and the external file “docs.xml” had the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<extradoc>
<class name="IntList">
<summary>
Contains a list of integers.
</summary>
</class>
<class name="StringList">
<summary>
Contains a list of integers.
</summary>
</class>
</extradoc>
```

then the same documentation is output as if the source code contained:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Contains a list of integers.
/// </summary>
public class IntList { … }
```

### <list>

This tag is used to create a list or table of items. It can contain a `<listheader>` block to define the heading row of either a table or definition list. (When defining a table, only an entry for *term* in the heading need be supplied.)

Each item in the list is specified with an `<item>` block. When creating a definition list, both *term* and *description* must be specified. However, for a table, bulleted list, or numbered list, only *description* need be specified.

**Syntax:**

```xml
<list type="bullet" | "number" | "table">
<listheader>
<term>term</term>
<description>description</description>
</listheader>

<item>
<term>term</term>
<description>description</description>
</item>

…

<item>
<term>term</term>
<description>description</description>
</item>
</list>
```

where

```csharp
> *term*
>
> The term to define, whose definition is in *description*.
>
> *description*
>
> Either an item in a bullet or numbered list, or the definition of a *term*.
```

**Example:**

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
/// <summary>Here is an example of a bulleted list:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>
/// <description>Item 1.</description>
/// </item>
/// <item>
/// <description>Item 2.</description>
/// </item>
/// </list>
/// </summary>
public static void Main () {
// …
}
}
```

### `<para>`}

This tag is for use inside other tags, such as `<summary>` (§D.3.16) or `<returns>` (§D.3.13), and permits structure to be added to text.

**Syntax:**
```HTML
<para>content</para>
```
where

```HTML
 content
```
 The text of the paragraph.


**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>This is the entry point of the Point class testing program.
/// <para>This program tests each method and operator, and
/// is intended to be run after any non-trvial maintenance has
/// been performed on the Point class.</para></summary>
public static void Main() {
// …
}
```

### `<param>`

This tag is used to describe a parameter for a method, constructor, or indexer.

**Syntax:**
```HTML
<param name="name">description</param>
```

where

```ANTLR
name
```
The name of the parameter.

```ANTLR
description
```
A description of the parameter.


**Example:**
```csharp
/// <summary>This method changes the point's location to
/// the given coordinates.</summary>
/// <param name="xor">the new x-coordinate.</param>
/// <param name="yor">the new y-coordinate.</param>
public void Move(int xor, int yor) {
X = xor;
Y = yor;
}
```

### `<paramref>`

This tag is used to indicate that a word is a parameter. The documentation file can be processed to format this parameter in some distinct way.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
<paramref name="name"/>
```
where

```
name
```
The name of the parameter.

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>This constructor initializes the new Point to
/// (<paramref name="xor"/>,<paramref name="yor"/>).</summary>
/// <param name="xor">the new Point's x-coordinate.</param>
/// <param name="yor">the new Point's y-coordinate.</param>

public Point(int xor, int yor) {
X = xor;
Y = yor;
}
```

### `<permission>`

This tag allows the security accessibility of a member to be documented.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<permission cref="member">description</permission>
```
where

```csharp
member
```
The name of a member. The documentation generator checks that the given code element exists and translates *member* to the canonical element name in the documentation file.

```csharp
description
```
A description of the access to the member.

**Example:**
```csharp
/// <permission cref="System.Security.PermissionSet">Everyone can
/// access this method.</permission>

public static void Test() {
// …
}
```

### `<remarks>`

This tag is used to specify extra information about a type. Use `<summary>` (§D.3.16) to describe the type itself and the members of a type.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<remarks>description</remarks>
```
where

```csharp
description
```
The text of the remark.

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>Class <c>Point</c> models a point in a
/// two-dimensional plane.</summary>
/// <remarks>Uses polar coordinates</remarks>
public class Point
{
// …
}
```

### `<returns>`

This tag is used to describe the return value of a method.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<returns>description</returns>
```
where

```
description
```
A description of the return value.

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>Report a point's location as a string.</summary>
/// <returns>A string representing a point's location, in the form (x,y),
/// without any leading, trailing, or embedded whitespace.</returns>
public override string ToString() {
return "(" + X + "," + Y + ")";
}
```

### `<see>`

This tag allows a link to be specified within text. Use `<seealso>` (§D.3.15) to indicate text that is to appear in a *See Also* subclause.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
<see cref="member"/>
```
where

```
member
```
The name of a member. The documentation generator checks that the given code element exists and changes *member* to the element name in the generated documentation file.

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>This method changes the point's location to
/// the given coordinates. <see cref="Translate"/></summary>

public void Move(int xor, int yor) {
X = xor;
Y = yor;
}

/// <summary>This method changes the point's location by
/// the given x- and y-offsets. <see cref="Move"/>
/// </summary>
public void Translate(int xor, int yor) {
X += xor;
Y += yor;
}
```

### `<seealso>`

This tag allows an entry to be generated for the *See Also* subclause. Use `<see>` (§D.3.14) to specify a link from within text.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<seealso cref="*member*"/>
```

where

```
member
```
The name of a member. The documentation generator checks that the given code element exists and changes *member* to the element name in the generated documentation file.

**Example:**

```csharp
/// <summary>This method determines whether two Points have the same
/// location.</summary>
/// <seealso cref="operator=="/>
/// <seealso cref="operator!="/>
public override bool Equals(object o) {
// …
}
```

### `<summary>`

This tag can be used to describe a type or a member of a type. Use `<remarks>` (§D.3.12) to describe the type itself.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<summary>*description*</summary>
```

where

```
description
```
A summary of the type or member.

**Example:**
```csharp
/// <summary>This constructor initializes the new Point to (0,0).</summary>
public Point() : this(0,0) {
}
```

### <typeparam>

This tag is used to describe a type parameter for a generic type or method.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<typeparam name="*name*">*description*</typeparam>
```

where

```
name
```
The name of the type parameter.

```
description
```
A description of the typeparameter.

**Example:**
```csharp
/// <summary>A generic list class.</summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The type stored by the list.</typeparam>
public class MyList<T> {
…
}
```

### `<typeparamref>`

This tag is used to indicate that a word is a type parameter. The documentation file can be processed to format this type parameter in some distinct way.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<typeparamref name="*name*"/>
```

where
```
Rname
```
The name of the type parameter.

**Example:**
```csharp
/// <summary>This method fetches data and returns a list of <typeparamref name=”T”> ”/>”> .</summary>
/// <param name="string">query to execute</param>

public List<T> FetchData<T>(string query) {
…
}
```

### `<value>`

This tag allows a property to be described.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
<value>property description</value>
```
where

```
property description
```
A description for the property.

**Example:**
```csharp
/// <value>Property <c>X</c> represents the point's x-coordinate.</value>
public int X
{
get { return x; }
set { x = value; }
}
```

## Processing the documentation file

### General

The following information is intended for C# implementations targeting the CLI.

The documentation generator generates an ID string for each element in the source code that is tagged with a documentation comment. This ID string uniquely identifies a source element. A documentation viewer can use an ID string to identify the corresponding item to which the documentation applies.

The documentation file is not a hierarchical representation of the source code; rather, it is a flat list with a generated ID string for each element.

### ID string format
The documentation generator observes the following rules when it generates the ID strings:

- No white space is placed in the string.
- The first part of the string identifies the kind of member being documented, via a single character followed by a colon. The following kinds of members are defined:

  |  **Character**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                      |
  |  ---------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  |  E              | Event |
  |  F              | Field |
  |  M              | Method (including constructors, finalizers, and operators) |
  |  N              | Namespace |
  |  P              | Property (including indexers) |
  |  T              | Type (such as class, delegate, enum, interface, and struct) |
  |  !              | Error string; the rest of the string provides information about the error. For example, the documentation generator generates error information for links that cannot be resolved. |
- The second part of the string is the fully qualified name of the element, starting at the root of the namespace. The name of the element, its enclosing type(s), and namespace are separated by periods. If the name of the item itself has periods, they are replaced by \# (U+0023) characters. (It is assumed that no element has this character in its name.)
- For methods and properties with arguments, the argument list follows, enclosed in parentheses. For those without arguments, the parentheses are omitted. The arguments are separated by commas. The encoding of each argument is the same as a CLI signature, as follows:
  - Arguments are represented by their documentation name, which is based on their fully qualified name, modified as follows:
- Arguments that represent generic types have an appended “’” character followed by the number of type parameters
- Arguments having the `out` or `ref` modifier have an `@` following their type name. Arguments passed by value or via params have no special notation.
- Arguments that are arrays are represented as [ *lowerbound* : *size* , … , *lowerbound* : *size* ] where the number of commas is the rank less one, and the lower bounds and size of each dimension, if known, are represented in decimal. If a lower bound or size is not specified, it is omitted. If the lower bound and size for a particular dimension are omitted, the “:” is omitted as well. Jagged arrays are represented by one “`[]`” per level.
- Arguments that have pointer types other than void are represented using a `*` following the type name. A void pointer is represented using a type name of `System.Void`.
- Arguments that refer to generic type parameters defined on types are encoded using the “`” character followed by the zero-based index of the type parameter.
- Arguments that use generic type parameters defined in methods use a double-backtick “````” instead of the “`” used for types.
- Arguments that refer to constructed generic types are encoded using the generic type, followed by “`{`“, followed by a comma-separated list of type arguments, followed by “`}`”.

### ID string examples

The following examples each show a fragment of C# code, along with the ID string produced from each source element capable of having a documentation comment:

- Types are represented using their fully qualified name, augmented with generic information:
  ```csharp
  enum Color { Red, Blue, Green }
  
  namespace Acme
  {
  	interface IProcess { … }
  
  	struct ValueType { … }
  
  	class Widget: IProcess
  	{
  		public class NestedClass { … }
  
  		public interface IMenuItem { … }
  
  		public delegate void Del(int i);
  
  		public enum Direction { North, South, East, West }
  	}
  
  	class MyList<T>
  	{
  		class Helper<U,V>{ … }
  	}
  }
