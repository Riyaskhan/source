# Expressions

## General

An expression is a sequence of operators and operands. This clause defines the syntax, order of evaluation of operands and operators, and meaning of expressions.

## Expression classifications

### General

An expression is classified as one of the following:

-   A value. Every value has an associated type.

-   A variable. Every variable has an associated type, namely the declared type of the variable.

-   A namespace. An expression with this classification can only appear as the left-hand side of a *member-access* (§12.7.5). In any other context, an expression classified as a namespace causes a compile-time error.

-   A type. An expression with this classification can only appear as the left-hand side of a *member-access* (§12.7.5). In any other context, an expression classified as a type causes a compile-time error.

-   A method group, which is a set of overloaded methods resulting from a member lookup (§12.5). A method group may have an associated instance expression and an associated type argument list. When an instance method is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8). A method group is permitted in an *invocation-expression* (§12.7.6) or a *delegate-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.6), and can be implicitly converted to a compatible delegate type (§11.8). In any other context, an expression classified as a method group causes a compile-time error.

-   A null literal. An expression with this classification can be implicitly converted to a reference type or nullable value type

-   An anonymous function. An expression with this classification can be implicitly converted to a compatible delegate type or expression tree type.

-   A property access. Every property access has an associated type, namely the type of the property. Furthermore, a property access may have an associated instance expression. When an accessor (the get or set block) of an instance property access is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8).

-   An event access. Every event access has an associated type, namely the type of the event. Furthermore, an event access may have an associated instance expression. An event access may appear as the left-hand operand of the `+=` and `-=` operators (§12.18.4). In any other context, an expression classified as an event access causes a compile-time error. When an accessor (the add or remove block) of an instance event access is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8).

-   An indexer access. Every indexer access has an associated type, namely the element type of the indexer. Furthermore, an indexer access has an associated instance expression and an associated argument list. When an accessor (the get or set block) of an indexer access is invoked, the result of evaluating the instance expression becomes the instance represented by this (§12.7.8), and the result of evaluating the argument list becomes the parameter list of the invocation.

-   Nothing. This occurs when the expression is an invocation of a method with a return type of void. An expression classified as nothing is only valid in the context of a *statement-expression* (§13.7).

The final result of an expression is never a namespace, type, method group, or event access. Rather, as noted above, these categories of expressions are intermediate constructs that are only permitted in certain contexts.

A property access or indexer access is always reclassified as a value by performing an invocation of the *get-accessor* or the *set-accessor*. The particular accessor is determined by the context of the property or indexer access: If the access is the target of an assignment, the *set-accessor* is invoked to assign a new value (§12.18.2). Otherwise, the *get-accessor* is invoked to obtain the current value (§12.2.2).

An ***instance accessor*** is a property access on an instance, an event access on an instance, or an indexer access.

### Values of expressions

Most of the constructs that involve an expression ultimately require the expression to denote a ***value***. In such cases, if the actual expression denotes a namespace, a type, a method group, or nothing, a compile-time error occurs. However, if the expression denotes a property access, an indexer access, or a variable, the value of the property, indexer, or variable is implicitly substituted:

-   The value of a variable is simply the value currently stored in the storage location identified by the variable. A variable shall be considered definitely assigned (§10.4) before its value can be obtained, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

-   The value of a property access expression is obtained by invoking the *get-accessor* of the property. If the property has no *get-accessor*, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, a function member invocation (§12.6.6) is performed, and the result of the invocation becomes the value of the property access expression.

-   The value of an indexer access expression is obtained by invoking the *get-accessor* of the indexer. If the indexer has no *get-accessor*, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, a function member invocation (§12.6.6) is performed with the argument list associated with the indexer access expression, and the result of the invocation becomes the value of[[#_Ref449406927 .anchor](#_Ref449406927 .anchor)][#_Ref448204715 .anchor](#_Ref448204715 .anchor) the indexer access expression.

## Static and Dynamic Binding

### General

***Binding*** is the process of determining what an operation refers to, based on the type or value of expressions (arguments, operands, receivers). For instance, the binding of a method call is determined based on the type of the receiver and arguments. The binding of an operator is determined based on the type of its operands.

In C# the binding of an operation is usually determined at compile-time, based on the compile-time type of its subexpressions. Likewise, if an expression contains an error, the error is detected and reported by the compiler. This approach is known as ***static binding***.

However, if an expression is a *dynamic expression* (i.e., has the type dynamic) this indicates that any binding that it participates in should be based on its run-time type rather than the type it has at compile-time. The binding of such an operation is therefore deferred until the time where the operation is to be executed during the running of the program. This is referred to as ***dynamic binding***.

When an operation is dynamically bound, little or no checking is performed by the compiler. Instead if the run-time binding fails, errors are reported as exceptions at run-time.

The following operations in C# are subject to binding:

-   Member access: `e.M`

-   Method invocation: `e.M(e~1~,…,e~n~)`

-   Delegate invocation: `e(e~1~,…,e~n~)`

-   Element access: `e[e~1~,…,e~n~]`

-   Object creation: new `C(e~1~,…,e~n~)`

-   Overloaded unary operators: `+`, `-`, `!`, `~`, `++`, `--`, `true`, `false`

-   Overloaded binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `??`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

-   Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`

-   Implicit and explicit conversions

When no dynamic expressions are involved, C# defaults to static binding, which means that the compile-time types of subexpressions are used in the selection process. However, when one of the subexpressions in the operations listed above is a dynamic expression, the operation is instead dynamically bound.

### Binding-time

Static binding takes place at compile-time, whereas dynamic binding takes place at run-time. In the following subclauses, the term ***binding-time*** refers to either compile-time or run-time, depending on when the binding takes place.

\[*Example*: The following illustrates the notions of static and dynamic binding and of binding-time:

```csharp
object o = 5;\
dynamic d = 5;

Console.WriteLine(5); // static binding to Console.WriteLine(int)\
Console.WriteLine(o); // static binding to Console.WriteLine(object)\
Console.WriteLine(d); // dynamic binding to Console.WriteLine(int)
```

The first two calls are statically bound: the overload of `Console.WriteLine` is picked based on the compile-time type of their argument. Thus, the binding-time is *compile-time*.

The third call is dynamically bound: the overload of `Console.WriteLine` is picked based on the run-time type of its argument. This happens because the argument is a dynamic expression – its compile-time type is dynamic. Thus, the binding-time for the third call is *run-time*. *end example*\]

### Dynamic binding

**This subclause is informative.**

Dynamic binding allows C# programs to interact with dynamic objects, i.e., objects that do not follow the normal rules of the C# type system. Dynamic objects may be objects from other programming languages with different types systems, or they may be objects that are programmatically setup to implement their own binding semantics for different operations.

The mechanism by which a dynamic object implements its own semantics is implementation defined. A given interface – again implementation defined – is implemented by dynamic objects to signal to the C# run-time that they have special semantics. Thus, whenever operations on a dynamic object are dynamically bound, their own binding semantics, rather than those of C# as specified in this specification, take over.

While the purpose of dynamic binding is to allow interoperation with dynamic objects, C# allows dynamic binding on all objects, whether they are dynamic or not. This allows for a smoother integration of dynamic objects, as the results of operations on them may not themselves be dynamic objects, but are still of a type unknown to the programmer at compile-time. Also, dynamic binding can help eliminate error-prone reflection-based code even when no objects involved are dynamic objects.

### Types of subexpressions

When an operation is statically bound, the type of a subexpression (e.g., a receiver, and argument, an index or an operand) is always considered to be the compile-time type of that expression.

When an operation is dynamically bound, the type of a subexpression is determined in different ways depending on the compile-time type of the subexpression:

-   A subexpression of compile-time type dynamic is considered to have the type of the actual value that the expression evaluates to at run-time

-   A subexpression whose compile-time type is a type parameter is considered to have the type which the type parameter is bound to at run-time

-   Otherwise, the subexpression is considered to have its compile-time type.

## Operators

### General

Expressions are constructed from ***operands*** and ***operators***. The operators of an expression indicate which operations to apply to the operands. \[*Example*: Examples of operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `new`. Examples of operands include literals, fields, local variables, and expressions. *end example*\]

There are three kinds of operators:

-   Unary operators. The unary operators take one operand and use either prefix notation (such as `–x`) or postfix notation (such as `x++`).

-   Binary operators. The binary operators take two operands and all use infix notation (such as `x + y`).

-   Ternary operator. Only one ternary `operator`, `?:`, `exists;` it takes three operands and uses infix notation (`c ? x : y`).

The order of evaluation of operators in an expression is determined by the ***precedence*** and ***associativity*** of the operators (§12.4.2).

Operands in an expression are evaluated from left to right. \[*Example*: In `F(i) + G(i++) * H(i)`, method `F` is called using the old value of `i`, then method `G` is called with the old value of `i`, and, finally, method `H` is called with the new value of i. This is separate from and unrelated to operator precedence. *end example*\]

Certain operators can be ***overloaded***. Operator overloading (§12.4.3) permits user-defined operator implementations to be specified for operations where one or both of the operands are of a user-defined class or struct type.

### Operator precedence and associativity

When an expression contains multiple operators, the ***precedence*** of the operators controls the order in which the individual operators are evaluated. \[*Note*: For example, the expression `x + y * z` is evaluated as `x + (y * z)` because the `*` operator has higher precedence than the binary `+` operator. *end note*\] The precedence of an operator is established by the definition of its associated grammar production. \[*Note*: For example, an *additive-expression* consists of a sequence of *multiplicative-expression*s separated by `+` or `-` operators, thus giving the `+` and `-` operators lower precedence than the `*`, `/`, and `%` operators. *end note*\]

> [!NOTE] 
> The following table summarizes all operators in order of precedence from highest to lowest:

  ------------------- ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  **Subclause**       **Category**                       **Operators**

  ------------------- ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------


When an operand occurs between two operators with the same precedence, the ***associativity*** of the operators controls the order in which the operations are performed:

-   Except for the assignment operators and the null coalescing operator, all binary operators are ***left-associative***, meaning that operations are performed from left to right. \[*Example*: `x + y + z` is evaluated as `(x + y) + z`. *end example*\]

-   The assignment operators, the null coalescing operator and the conditional operator (?:) are ***right-associative***, meaning that operations are performed from right to left. \[*Example*: `x = y = z` is evaluated as `x = (y = z)`. *end example*\]

Precedence and associativity can be controlled using parentheses. \[*Example*: `x + y * z` first multiplies `y` by `z` and then adds the result to `x`, but` (x + y) * z` first adds `x` and `y` and then multiplies the result by `z`. *end example*\][[[#_Toc503164081 .anchor](#_Toc503164081 .anchor)][#_Toc501035391 .anchor](#_Toc501035391 .anchor)][#_Ref461356007 .anchor](#_Ref461356007 .anchor)

### Operator overloading

All unary and binary operators have predefined implementations that are automatically available in any expression. In addition to the predefined implementations, user-defined implementations can be introduced by including operator declarations (§15.10) in classes and structs. User-defined operator implementations always take precedence over predefined operator implementations: Only when no applicable user-defined operators implementations exist will the predefined operator implementations be considered, as described in §12.4.4 and §12.4.5.

The ***overloadable unary operators*** are:

`+ - ! ~ ++ -- true false`

> [!NOTE] 
> Although true and false are not used explicitly in expressions (and therefore are not included in the precedence table in §12.4.2), they are considered operators because they are invoked in several expression contexts: Boolean expressions (§12.21) and expressions involving the conditional (§12.15) and conditional logical operators (§12.13).

The ***overloadable binary operators*** are:

`+ - * / % & | ^ << >> == != > < <= >=`

Only the operators listed above can be overloaded. In particular, it is not possible to overload member access, method invocation, or the `=`, `&&`, `||`, `??`, `?:`, `=>`, checked, unchecked, new, typeof, default, as, and is operators.

When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding compound assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded. \[*Example*: An overload of operator `*` is also an overload of operator `*=`. This is described further in §12.18. *end example*\] The assignment operator itself `(=)` cannot be overloaded. An assignment always performs a simple store of a value into a variable(§12.18.2).

Cast operations, such as `(T)x`, are overloaded by providing user-defined conversions (§11.5). 

> [!NOTE]
> User-defined conversions do not affect the behavior of the is or as operators.
>
> Element access, such as `a[x]`, is not considered an overloadable operator. Instead, user-defined indexing is supported through indexers (§15.9).
>
> In expressions, operators are referenced using operator notation, and in declarations, operators are referenced using functional notation. The following table shows the relationship between operator and functional notations for unary and binary operators. In the first entry, *op* denotes any overloadable unary prefix operator. In the second entry, *op* denotes the unary postfix `++` and `--` operators. In the third entry, *op* denotes any overloadable binary operator. \[*Note*: For an example of overloading the `++` and `--` operators see §15.10.2.

  ----------------------- -------------------------
  **Operator notation**   **Functional notation**
  *op* x                  operator *op*(x)
  x *op*                  operator *op*(x)
  x *op* y                operator *op*(x, y)
  ----------------------- -------------------------

User-defined operator declarations always require at least one of the parameters to be of the class or struct type that contains the operator declaration. 
> [!NOTE]
>  Thus, it is not possible for a user-defined operator to have the same signature as a predefined operator. 

User-defined operator declarations cannot modify the syntax, precedence, or associativity of an operator. \[*Example*: The / operator is always a binary operator, always has the precedence level specified in §12.4.2, and is always left-associative. *end example*\]


> [!NOTE]
>  While it is possible for a user-defined operator to perform any computation it pleases, implementations that produce results other than those that are intuitively expected are strongly discouraged. For example, an implementation of operator `==` should compare the two operands for equality and return an appropriate bool result. 

The descriptions of individual operators in §12.8 through §12.18 specify the predefined implementations of the operators and any additional rules that apply to each operator. The descriptions make use of the terms ***unary operator overload resolution***, ***binary operator overload resolution***, ***numeric promotion***, and ***lifted operators*** definitions of which are found in the following subclauses.

### Unary operator overload resolution

An operation of the form *op* `x` or `x` *op*, where *op* is an overloadable unary operator, and `x` is an expression of type `X`, is processed as follows:

-   The set of candidate user-defined operators provided by `X` for the operation operator *op*(`x`) is determined using the rules of §12.4.6.

-   If the set of candidate user-defined operators is not empty, then this becomes the set of candidate operators for the operation. Otherwise, the predefined binary operator *op* implementations, including their lifted forms, become the set of candidate operators for the operation. The predefined implementations of a given operator are specified in the description of the operator. The predefined operators provided by an enum or delegate type are only included in this set when the binding-time type—or the underlying type if it is a nullable type—of either operand is the enum or delegate type.

-   The overload resolution rules of §12.6.4 are applied to the set of candidate operators to select the best operator with respect to the argument list (`x`), and this operator becomes the result of the overload resolution process. If overload resolution fails to select a single best operator, a binding-time error occurs.

### Binary operator overload resolution

An operation of the form `x` *op *`y`, where *op* is an overloadable binary operator, `x` is an expression of type `X`, and `y` is an expression of type `Y`, is processed as follows:

-   The set of candidate user-defined operators provided by `X` and `Y` for the operation operator *op*`(x, y)` is determined. The set consists of the union of the candidate operators provided by `X` and the candidate operators provided by `Y`, each determined using the rules of §12.4.6. For the combined set, candidates are merged as follows:

<!-- -->

-   If X and `Y` are the same type, or if `X` and `Y` are derived from a common base type, then shared candidate operators only occur in the combined set once.

-   If there is an identity conversion between `X` and `Y`, an operator *op*`Y` provided by `Y` has the same return type as an *op*`X` provided by `X` and the operand types of *op*`Y` have an identity conversion to the corresponding operand types of *op*`X` then only *op*`X` occurs in the set.

<!-- -->

-   If the set of candidate user-defined operators is not empty, then this becomes the set of candidate operators for the operation. Otherwise, the predefined binary operator *op* implementations, including their lifted forms, become the set of candidate operators for the operation. The predefined implementations of a given operator are specified in the description of the operator. For predefined enum and delegate operators, the only operators considered are those provided by an enum or delegate type that is the binding-time type of one of the operands.

-   The overload resolution rules of §12.6.4 are applied to the set of candidate operators to select the best operator with respect to the argument list (`x, y`), and this operator becomes the result of the overload resolution process. If overload resolution fails to select a single best operator, a binding-time error occurs.

### Candidate user-defined operators

Given a type `T` and an operation operator *op*(`A`), where *op* is an overloadable operator and `A` is an argument list, the set of candidate user-defined operators provided by `T` for operator *op*(`A`) is determined as follows:

-   Determine the type `T~0~`. If `T` is a nullable value type, `T~0~` is its underlying type; otherwise, `T~0~` is equal to `T`.

-   For all operator *op* declarations in `T~0~` and all lifted forms of such operators, if at least one operator is applicable (§12.6.4.2) with respect to the argument list `A`, then the set of candidate operators consists of all such applicable operators in `T~0~`.

-   Otherwise, if `T~0~` is object, the set of candidate operators is empty.

-   Otherwise, the set of candidate operators provided by `T~0~` is the set of candidate operators provided by the direct base class of `T~0~`, or the effective base class of `T~0~` if `T~0~` is a type parameter.

### Numeric promotions

#### General

**This subclause is informative.**

Numeric promotion consists of automatically performing certain implicit conversions of the operands of the predefined unary and binary numeric operators. Numeric promotion is not a distinct mechanism, but rather an effect of applying overload resolution to the predefined operators. Numeric promotion specifically does not affect evaluation of user-defined operators, although user-defined operators can be implemented to exhibit similar effects.

[#_Ref450957799 .anchor](#_Ref450957799 .anchor)As an example of numeric promotion, consider the predefined implementations of the binary \* operator:

```csharp
int operator *(int x, int y);
uint operator *(uint x, uint y);
long operator *(long x, long y);
ulong operator *(ulong x, ulong y);
float operator *(float x, float y);
double operator *(double x, double y);
decimal operator *(decimal x, decimal y);
```

When overload resolution rules (§12.6.4) are applied to this set of operators, the effect is to select the first of the operators for which implicit conversions exist from the operand types. \[*Example*: For the operation `b` \* s, where `b` is a byte and `s` is a short, overload resolution selects operator \*(`int`, `int`) as the best operator. Thus, the effect is that `b` and `s` are converted to `int`, and the type of the result is `int`. Likewise, for the operation `i` \* `d`, where `i` is an `int` and `d` is a `double`, `overload` resolution selects operator \*(`double, double`) as the best operator. *end example*\]

**End of informative text.**

#### Unary numeric promotions

**This subclause is informative.**

Unary numeric promotion occurs for the operands of the predefined `+`, `–`, and `~` unary operators. Unary numeric promotion simply consists of converting operands of type `sbyte, byte, short, ushort`, or `char` to type `int`. Additionally, for the unary – operator, unary numeric promotion converts operands of type `uint` to type `long`.

**End of informative text.**

#### Binary numeric promotions

**This subclause is informative.**

Binary numeric promotion occurs for the operands of the predefined `+, –, *, /, %, &, |, ^, ==, !=, >, <, >=,` and `<=` binary operators. Binary numeric promotion implicitly converts both operands to a common type which, in case of the non-relational operators, also becomes the result type of the operation. Binary numeric promotion consists of applying the following rules, in the order they appear here:

-   If either operand is of type `decimal`, the other operand is converted to type `decimal`, or a binding-time error occurs if the other operand is of type `float` or `double`.

-   Otherwise, if either operand is of type `double, the other operand is converted to type `double`.

-   Otherwise, if either operand is of type `float`, the other operand is converted to type `float`.

-   Otherwise, if either operand is of type `ulong`, the other operand is converted to type `ulong`, or a binding-time error occurs if the other operand is of `type sbyte`, `short`, `int`, or `long`.

-   Otherwise, if either operand is of type `long`, the other operand is converted to type `long`.

-   Otherwise, if either operand is of type `uint` and the other operand is of type `sbyte`, `short`, or `int`, both operands are converted to type `long`.

-   Otherwise, if either operand is of type `uint`, the other operand is converted to type `uint`.

-   Otherwise, both operands are converted to type `int`.


> [!NOTE]
>  The first rule disallows any operations that mix the decimal type with the double and float types. The rule follows from the fact that there are no implicit conversions between the decimal type and the double and float types. 


> [!NOTE]
>  Also note that it is not possible for an operand to be of type ulong when the other operand is of a signed integral type. The reason is that no integral type exists that can represent the full range of ulong as well as the signed integral types. 

In both of the above cases, a cast expression can be used to explicitly convert one operand to a type that is compatible with the other operand.

\[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
decimal AddPercent(decimal x, double percent) {
return x * (1.0 + percent / 100.0);
}
```

a binding-time error occurs because a decimal cannot be multiplied by a double. The error is resolved by explicitly converting the second operand to decimal, as follows:

```csharp
decimal AddPercent(decimal x, double percent) {
return x * (decimal)(1.0 + percent / 100.0);
}
```

*end example*\]

**End of informative text.**

### Lifted operators

***Lifted operators*** permit predefined and user-defined operators that operate on non-nullable value types to also be used with nullable forms of those types. Lifted operators are constructed from predefined and user-defined operators that meet certain requirements, as described in the following:

-   For the unary operators

`+ ++ - -- ! ~`

a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand and result types are both non-nullable value types. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single ? modifier to the operand and result types. The lifted operator produces a null value if the operand is null. Otherwise, the lifted operator unwraps the operand, applies the underlying operator, and wraps the result.

-   For the binary operators

`+ - * / % & | ^ << >>`

a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand and result types are all non-nullable value types. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single ? modifier to each operand and result type. The lifted operator produces a null value if one or both operands are null (an exception being the & and | operators of the bool? type, as described in §12.12.5). Otherwise, the lifted operator unwraps the operands, applies the underlying operator, and wraps the result.

-   For the equality operators

`== !=`

a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand types are both non-nullable value types and if the result type is bool. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single ? modifier to each operand type. The lifted operator considers two null values equal, and a null value unequal to any non-null value. If both operands are non-null, the lifted operator unwraps the operands and applies the underlying operator to produce the bool result.

-   For the relational operators

`< > <= >=`

a lifted form of an operator exists if the operand types are both non-nullable value types and if the result type is bool. The lifted form is constructed by adding a single `?` modifier to each operand type. The lifted operator produces the value false if one or both operands are null. Otherwise, the lifted operator unwraps the operands and applies the underlying operator to produce the bool result.

## Member lookup

### General

A member lookup is the process whereby the meaning of a name in the context of a type is determined. A member lookup can occur as part of evaluating a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) or a *member-access* (§12.7.5) in an expression. If the *simple-name* or *member-access* occurs as the *primary-expression* of an *invocation-expression* (§12.7.6.2), the member is said to be *invoked*.

If a member is a method or event, or if it is a constant, field or property of either a delegate type (§20) or the type dynamic (§9.2.4), then the member is said to be *invocable.*

Member lookup considers not only the name of a member but also the number of type parameters the member has and whether the member is accessible. For the purposes of member lookup, generic methods and nested generic types have the number of type parameters indicated in their respective declarations and all other members have zero type parameters.

A member lookup of a name `N` with `K` type arguments in a type `T` is processed as follows:

-   First, a set of accessible members named `N` is determined:

<!-- -->

-   If `T` is a type parameter, then the set is the union of the sets of accessible members named `N` in each of the types specified as a primary constraint or secondary constraint (§15.2.5) for `T`, along with the set of accessible members named `N` in object.

-   Otherwise, the set consists of all accessible (§8.5) members named `N` in `T`, including inherited members and the accessible members named `N` in object. If `T` is a constructed type, the set of members is obtained by substituting type arguments as described in §15.3.3. Members that include an override modifier are excluded from the set.

<!-- -->

-   Next, if `K` is zero, all nested types whose declarations include type parameters are removed. If `K` is not zero, all members with a different number of type parameters are removed. When `K` is zero, methods having type parameters are not removed, since the type inference process (§12.6.3) might be able to infer the type arguments.

-   Next, if the member is invoked, all non-invocable members are removed from the set.

-   Next, members that are hidden by other members are removed from the set. For every member `S.M` in the set, where `S` is the type in which the member `M` is declared, the following rules are applied:

<!-- -->

-   If `M` is a constant, field, property, event, or enumeration member, then all members declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.

-   If `M` is a type declaration, then all non-types declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set, and all type declarations with the same number of type parameters as `M` declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.

-   If `M` is a method, then all non-method members declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.

<!-- -->

-   Next, interface members that are hidden by class members are removed from the set. This step only has an effect if `T` is a type parameter and `T` has both an effective base class other than object and a non-empty effective interface set (§15.2.5). For every member `S.M` in the set, where `S` is the type in which the member `M` is declared, the following rules are applied if `S` is a class declaration other than object:

<!-- -->

-   If `M` is a constant, field, property, event, enumeration member, or type declaration, then all members declared in an interface declaration are removed from the set.

-   If `M` is a method, then all non-method members declared in an interface declaration are removed from the set, and all methods with the same signature as `M` declared in an interface declaration are removed from the set.

<!-- -->

-   Finally, having removed hidden members, the result of the lookup is determined:

<!-- -->

-   If the set consists of a single member that is not a method, then this member is the result of the lookup.

-   Otherwise, if the set contains only methods, then this group of methods is the result of the lookup.

-   Otherwise, the lookup is ambiguous, and a binding-time error occurs.

For member lookups in types other than type parameters and interfaces, and member lookups in interfaces that are strictly single-inheritance (each interface in the inheritance chain has exactly zero or one direct base interface), the effect of the lookup rules is simply that derived members hide base members with the same name or signature. Such single-inheritance lookups are never ambiguous. The ambiguities that can possibly arise from member lookups in multiple-inheritance interfaces are described in §18.4.6. 
> [!NOTE]
>  This phase only accounts for one kind of ambiguity. If the member lookup results in a method group, further uses of method group may fail due to ambiguity, for example as described in §12.6.4.1 and §12.6.6.2. 

### Base types

For purposes of member lookup, a type `T` is considered to have the following base types:

-   If `T` is object or dynamic, then `T` has no base type.

-   If `T` is an *`enum-type`*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.Enum`, `System.ValueType`, and `object`.

-   If `T` is a *`struct-type`*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.ValueType` and `object`. 
> [!NOTE]
>  A *`nullable-value-type`* is a *`struct-type`* (§9.3.1). 

-   If `T` is a *`class-type`*, the base types of `T` are the base classes of `T`, including the class type `object`.

-   If `T` is an *`interface-type`*, the base types of `T` are the base interfaces of `T` and the class type `object`.

-   If `T` is an *`array-type`*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.Array` and `object`.

-   If `T` is a *`delegate-type`*, the base types of `T` are the class types `System.Delegate` and `object`.

## Function members

### General

Function members are members that contain executable statements. Function members are always members of types and cannot be members of namespaces. C# defines the following categories of function members:

-   Methods

-   Properties

-   Events

-   Indexers

-   User-defined operators

-   Instance constructors

-   Static constructors

-   Finalizers

Except for finalizers and static constructors (which cannot be invoked explicitly), the statements contained in function members are executed through function member invocations. The actual syntax for writing a function member invocation depends on the particular function member category.

The argument list (§12.6.2) of a function member invocation provides actual values or variable references for the parameters of the function member.

Invocations of generic methods may employ type inference to determine the set of type arguments to pass to the method. This process is described in §12.6.3.

Invocations of methods, indexers, operators, and instance constructors employ overload resolution to determine which of a candidate set of function members to invoke. This process is described in §12.6.4.

Once a particular function member has been identified at binding-time, possibly through overload resolution, the actual run-time process of invoking the function member is described in §12.6.6.


> [!NOTE]
>  The following table summarizes the processing that takes place in constructs involving the six categories of function members that can be explicitly invoked. In the `table, e, x, y`, and `value` indicate expressions classified as `variables` or `values`, `T` indicates an expression classified as a `type`, `F` is the simple name of a `method`, and `P` is the simple name of a `property`.

  --------------------------------- ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Construct**                     **Example**         **Description**
  Method invocation                 `F(x, y)`             Overload resolution is applied to select the best method `F` in the containing `class` or `struct`. The method is invoked with the argument list (`x, y`). If the method is not static, the instance expression is this.
                                    `T.F(x, y)`           Overload resolution is applied to select the best method `F` in the `class` or `struct` `T`. A binding-time error occurs if the method is not static. The method is invoked with the argument list (`x, y`).
                                    `e.F(x, y)`           Overload resolution is applied to select the best method `F` in the `class`, `struct`, or `interface` given by the type of `e`.

                                    `e.P`                 The get accessor of the property `P` in the `class`, `struct`, or `interface` given by the type of `E` is invoked with the instance expression `e`. A binding-time error occurs if `P` is static or if `P` is write-only.
                                    `e.P = value`         The set accessor of the property `P` in the `class`, `struct`, or `interface` given by the type of `E` is invoked with the instance expression `E` and the argument list (value). A binding-time error occurs if `P` is static or if `P` is read-only.
  Event access                      `E += value`          The add accessor of the event `E` in the containing `class` or `struct` is invoked. If `E` is not static, the instance expression is this.

  Indexer access                    `e[x, y]`           Overload resolution is applied to select the best indexer in the `class`, `struct`, or `interface` given by the type of `e`. The get accessor of the indexer is invoked with the instance expression `E` and the argument list (`x, y`). A binding-time error occurs if the indexer is write-only.
                                    `e[x, y] = value`   Overload resolution is applied to select the best indexer in the `class`, `struct`, or `interface` given by the type of `e`. The set accessor of the indexer is invoked with the instance expression `E` and the argument list (`x, y, value`). A binding-time error occurs if the indexer is read-only.
  Operator invocation               `-x`                  Overload resolution is applied to select the best unary operator in the `class` or `struct` given by the type of `x`. The selected operator is invoked with the argument list (`x`).
                                    `x + y`               Overload resolution is applied to select the best binary operator in the `class`es or `struct`s given by the types of `x` and `y`. The selected operator is invoked with the argument list (`x, y`).
  Instance con`struct`or invocation   `new T(x, y)`         Overload resolution is applied to select the best instance con`struct`or in the `class` or `struct` `T`. The instance con`struct`or is invoked with the argument list (`x, y`).

### Argument lists

#### General

Every function member and delegate invocation includes an argument list, which provides actual values or variable references for the parameters of the function member. The syntax for specifying the argument list of a function member invocation depends on the function member category:

-   For instance constructors, methods, indexers and delegates, the arguments are specified as an *argument-list*, as described below. For indexers, when invoking the set accessor, the argument list additionally includes the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator. 

> [!NOTE]
>  This additional argument is not used for overload resolution, just during invocation of the set accessor. 

-   For properties, the argument list is empty when invoking the get accessor, and consists of the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator when invoking the set accessor.

-   For events, the argument list consists of the expression specified as the right operand of the `+=` or `-=` operator.

-   For user-defined operators, the argument list consists of the single operand of the unary operator or the two operands of the binary operator.

The arguments of properties (§15.7), events (§15.8), and user-defined operators (§15.10) are always passed as value parameters (§15.6.2.2). The arguments of indexers (§15.9) are always passed as value parameters (§15.6.2.2) or parameter arrays (§15.6.2.5). Reference and output parameters are not supported for these categories of function members.

The arguments of an instance `constructor`, `method`, `indexer`, or `delegate` invocation are specified as an *argument-list*:

[#Grammar_argument_list .anchor](#Grammar_argument_list .anchor)
```ANTLR
argument-list:
	argument

	argument-list , argument
```
[#Grammar_argument .anchor](#Grammar_argument .anchor)
```ANTLR
argument:
	argument-name~opt~ argument-value
```

[#Grammar_argument_name .anchor](#Grammar_argument_name .anchor)
```ANTLR
argument-name:
	identifier :
```

[#Grammar_argument_value .anchor](#Grammar_argument_value .anchor)
```ANTLR
argument-value:
	expression
	ref variable-reference
	out variable-reference
```
An *argument-list* consists of one or more *argument*s, separated by commas. Each argument consists of an optional *argument-name* followed by an *argument-value*. An *argument* with an *argument-name* is referred to as a ***named argument***, whereas an *argument* without an *argument-name* is a ***positional argument***. It is an error for a positional argument to appear after a named argument in an *argument-list*.

The *argument-value* can take one of the following forms:

-   An *expression*, indicating that the argument is passed as a value parameter (§15.6.2.2).

-   The keyword ref followed by a *variable-reference* (§10.5), indicating that the argument is passed as a reference parameter (§15.6.2.3). A variable shall be definitely assigned (§10.4) before it can be passed as a reference parameter.

-   The keyword out followed by a *variable-reference* (§10.5), indicating that the argument is passed as an output parameter (§15.6.2.4). A variable is considered definitely assigned (§10.4) following a function member invocation in which the variable is passed as an output parameter.

The form determines the ***parameter-passing mode*** of the argument: *value*, *reference*, or *output*, respectively.

Passing a volatile field (§15.5.4) as a reference parameter or output parameter causes a warning, since the field may not be treated as volatile by the invoked method.

#### Corresponding parameters

For each argument in an argument list there has to be a corresponding parameter in the function member or delegate being invoked.

The parameter list used in the following is determined as follows:

-   For virtual methods and indexers defined in classes, the parameter list is picked from the first declaration or override of the function member found when starting with the static type of the receiver, and searching through its base classes.

-   For partial methods, the parameter list of the defining partial method declaration is used.

-   For all other function members and delegates there is only a single parameter list, which is the one used.

The position of an argument or parameter is defined as the number of arguments or parameters preceding it in the argument list or parameter list.

The corresponding parameters for function member arguments are established as follows:

-   Arguments in the *argument-list* of instance constructors, methods, indexers and delegates:

<!-- -->

-   A positional argument where a parameter occurs at the same position in the parameter list corresponds to that parameter, unless the parameter is a parameter array and the function member is invoked in its expanded form.

-   A positional argument of a function member with a parameter array invoked in its expanded form, which occurs at or after the position of the parameter array in the parameter list, corresponds to an element in the parameter array.

-   A named argument corresponds to the parameter of the same name in the parameter list.

-   For indexers, when invoking the set accessor, the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator corresponds to the implicit value parameter of the set accessor declaration.

<!-- -->

-   For properties, when invoking the get accessor there are no arguments. When invoking the set accessor, the expression specified as the right operand of the assignment operator corresponds to the implicit value parameter of the set accessor declaration.

-   For user-defined unary operators (including conversions), the single operand corresponds to the single parameter of the operator declaration.

-   For user-defined binary operators, the left operand corresponds to the first parameter, and the right operand corresponds to the second parameter of the operator declaration.

#### Run-time evaluation of argument lists

During the run-time processing of a function member invocation (§12.6.6), the expressions or variable references of an argument list are evaluated in order, from left to right, as follows:

-   For a value parameter, the argument expression is evaluated and an implicit conversion (§11.2) to the corresponding parameter type is performed. The resulting value becomes the initial value of the value parameter in the function member invocation.

-   For a reference or output parameter, the variable reference is evaluated and the resulting storage location becomes the storage location represented by the parameter in the function member invocation. If the variable reference given as a reference or output parameter is an array element of a *reference-type*, a run-time check is performed to ensure that the element type of the array is identical to the type of the parameter. If this check fails, a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` is thrown.

Methods, indexers, and instance constructors may declare their right-most parameter to be a parameter array (§15.6.2.5). Such function members are invoked either in their normal form or in their expanded form depending on which is applicable (§12.6.4.2):

-   When a function member with a parameter array is invoked in its normal form, the argument given for the parameter array shall be a single expression that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the parameter array type. In this case, the parameter array acts precisely like a value parameter.

-   When a function member with a parameter array is invoked in its expanded form, the invocation shall specify zero or more positional arguments for the parameter array, where each argument is an expression that is implicitly convertible (§11.2) to the element type of the parameter array. In this case, the invocation creates an instance of the parameter array type with a length corresponding to the number of arguments, initializes the elements of the array instance with the given argument values, and uses the newly created array instance as the actual argument.

The expressions of an argument list are always evaluated in textual order. \[*Example*: Thus, the example

```csharp
class Test
	{
	static void F(int x, int y = -1, int z = -2) {
		System.Console.WriteLine("x = {0}, y = {1}, z = {2}", x, y, z);
	}
	
	static void Main() {
		int i = 0;
		F(i++, i++, i++);
		F(z: i++, x: i++);
		}
}
	
produces the output
	
x = 0, y = 1, z = 2
x = 4, y = -1, z = 3
```

*end example*\]

The array co-variance rules (§17.6) permit a value of an array type `A`\[\] to be a reference to an instance of an array type `B`\[\], provided an implicit reference conversion exists from `B` to `A`. Because of these rules, when an array element of a *reference-type* is passed as a reference or output parameter, a run-time check is required to ensure that the actual element type of the array is *identical* to that of the parameter. \[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
	{
	static void F(ref object x) {…}
	
	static void Main() {
		object[] a = new object[10];
		object[] b = new string[10];
		F(ref a[0]); // Ok
		F(ref b[1]); // ArrayTypeMismatchException
	}
}
```

the second invocation of `F` causes `a` `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` to be thrown because the actual element type of `b` is string and not object. *end example*\]

When a function member with a parameter array is invoked in its expanded form, the invocation is processed exactly as if an array creation expression with an array initializer (§12.7.11.5) was inserted around the expanded parameters. \[*Example*: Given the declaration

```csharp
void F(int x, int y, params object[] args);
```

the following invocations of the expanded form of the method

```csharp
F(10, 20);
F(10, 20, 30, 40);
F(10, 20, 1, "hello", 3.0);
```
correspond exactly to

```csharp
F(10, 20, new object[] {});
F(10, 20, new object[] {30, 40});
F(10, 20, new object[] {1, "hello", 3.0});
```

In particular, note that an empty array is created when there are zero arguments given for the parameter array. *end example*\]

When arguments are omitted from a function member with corresponding optional parameters, the default arguments of the function member declaration are implicitly passed. 
> [!NOTE]
>  Because these are always constant, their evaluation will not impact the evaluation of the remaining arguments. 

### Type inference

#### General

When a generic method is called without specifying type arguments, a ***type inference*** process attempts to infer type arguments for the call. The presence of type inference allows a more convenient syntax to be used for calling a generic method, and allows the programmer to avoid specifying redundant type information. \[*Example*: Given the method declaration:

```csharp
class Chooser
{
	static Random rand = new Random();

	public static T Choose<T>(T first, T second) {
		return (rand.Next(2) == 0)? first: second;
	}
}
```

it is possible to invoke the Choose method without explicitly specifying a type argument:

```csharp
int i = Chooser.Choose(5, 213); // Calls Choose<int>
	
string s = Chooser.Choose("foo", "bar"); // Calls Choose<string>
```

Through type inference, the type arguments int and string are determined from the arguments to the method. *end example*\]

Type inference occurs as part of the binding-time processing of a method invocation (§12.7.6.2) and takes place before the overload resolution step of the invocation. When a particular method group is specified in a method invocation, and no type arguments are specified as part of the method invocation, type inference is applied to each generic method in the method group. If type inference succeeds, then the inferred type arguments are used to determine the types of arguments for subsequent overload resolution. If overload resolution chooses a generic method as the one to invoke, then the inferred type arguments are used as the type arguments for the invocation. If type inference for a particular method fails, that method does not participate in overload resolution. The failure of type inference, in and of itself, does not cause a binding-time error. However, it often leads to a binding-time error when overload resolution then fails to find any applicable methods.

If each supplied argument does not correspond to exactly one parameter in the method (§12.6.2.2), or there is a non-optional parameter with no corresponding argument, then inference immediately fails. Otherwise, assume that the generic method has the following signature:

```csharp
T~r~ M&lt;X~1~…X~n~&gt;(T~1~ p~1~ … T~m~ p~m~)
```

With a method call of the form `M(E~1~ …E~m~)` the task of type inference is to find unique type arguments `S~1~…S~n~` for each of the type parameters `X~1~…X~n~` so that the call `M<S~1~…S~n~>(E~1~…E~m~)`becomes valid.

The process of type inference is described below as an algorithm. A conformant compiler may be implemented using an alternative approach, provided it reaches the same result in all cases.

During the process of inference each type parameter `X~i~` is either *fixed* to a particular type `S~i~` or *unfixed* with an associated set of *bounds.* Each of the bounds is some type `T`. Initially each type variable `X~i~` is unfixed with an empty set of bounds.

Type inference takes place in phases. Each phase will try to infer type arguments for more type variables based on the findings of the previous phase. The first phase makes some initial inferences of bounds, whereas the second phase fixes type variables to specific types and infers further bounds. The second phase may have to be repeated a number of times.

> [!NOTE]
> Type inference takes place not only when a generic method is called. Type inference for conversion of method groups is described in §12.6.3.14 and finding the best common type of a set of expressions is described in §12.6.3.15. 

#### The first phase

For each of the method arguments `E~i~`:

-   If `E~i~` is an anonymous function, an *explicit parameter type inference* (§12.6.3.8) is made *from* `E~i~` *to* `T~i~`

-   Otherwise, if `E~i~` has a type `U` and `x~i~` is a value parameter (§15.6.2.2) then a *lower-bound inference* (§12.6.3.10) is made *from* `U` *to* `T~i~`.

-   Otherwise, if `E~i~` has a type `U` and `x~i~` is a reference (§15.6.2.3) or output (§15.6.2.4) parameter then an *exact inference* (§12.6.3.9) is made *from* `U` *to* `T~i~`.

-   Otherwise, no inference is made for this argument.

#### The second phase

The second phase proceeds as follows:

-   All *unfixed* type variables `X~i~` which do not *depend on* (§12.6.3.6) any `X~j~` are fixed (§12.6.3.12).

-   If no such type variables exist, all *unfixed* type variables `X~i~` are *fixed* for which all of the following hold:

    -   There is at least one type variable `X~j~` that *depends on* `X~i~`

    -   `X~i~` has a non-empty set of bounds

-   If no such type variables exist and there are still *unfixed* type variables, type inference fails.

-   Otherwise, if no further *unfixed* type variables exist, type inference succeeds.

-   Otherwise, for all arguments `E~i~` with corresponding parameter type `T~i~` where the *output types* (§12.6.3.5) contain *unfixed* type variables `X~j~` but the *input types* (§12.6.3.4) do not, an *output type inference* (§12.6.3.7) is made *from* `E~i~` *to* `T~i~`. Then the second phase is repeated.

#### Input types

If `E` is a method group or implicitly typed anonymous function and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type then all the parameter types of `T` are *input types* *of* `E` *with type* `T`.

####  Output types

If `E` is a method group or an anonymous function and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type then the return type of `T` is an *output type* *of* `E` *with type* `T`.

#### Dependence

An *unfixed* type variable `X~i~` *depends directly on* an *unfixed* type variable `X~j~` if for some argument `E~k~` with type `T~k~` `X~j~` occurs in an *input type* of `E~k~` with type `T~k~` and `X~i~` occurs in an *output type* of `E~k~` with type `T~k~`.

`X~j~` *depends on* `X~i~` if `X~j~` *depends directly on* `X~i~` or if `X~i~` *depends directly on* `X~k~` and `X~k~` *depends on* `X~j~`. Thus “*depends on*” is the transitive but not reflexive closure of “*depends directly on*”.

#### Output type inferences

An *output type inference* is made *from* an expression `E` *to* a type T in the following way:

-   If `E` is an anonymous function with inferred return type `U` (§12.6.3.13) and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type with return type `T~b~`, then a *lower-bound inference* (§12.6.3.10) is made *from* `U` *to* `T~b~`.

-   Otherwise, if `E` is a method group and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type with parameter types `T~1~…T~k~` and return type `T~b~`, and overload resolution of `E` with the types `T~1~…T~k~` yields a single method with return type `U`, then a *lower-bound inference* is made *from* `U` *to* `T~b~`.

-   Otherwise, if `E` is an expression with type `U`, then a *lower-bound inference* is made *from* `U` *to* `T`.

-   Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Explicit parameter type inferences

An *explicit parameter type inference* is made *from* an expression `E` *to* a type `T` in the following way:

-   If `E` is an explicitly typed anonymous function with parameter types `U~1~…U~k~` and `T` is a delegate type or expression tree type with parameter types `V~1~…V~k~` then for each `U~i~` an *exact inference* (§12.6.3.9) is made *from* `U~i~` *to* the corresponding `V~i~`.

#### Exact inferences

An *exact inference* *from* a type `U` *to* a type `V` is made as follows:

-   If `V` is one of the *unfixed* `X~i~` then `U` is added to the set of exact bounds for `X~i~`.

-   Otherwise, sets `V~1~…V~k~` and `U~1~…U~k~` are determined by checking if any of the following cases apply:

<!-- -->

-   `V` is an array type `V~1~[…]` and `U` is an array type `U~1~[…]` of the same rank

-   `V` is the type `V~1~?` and `U` is the type `U~1~?`

-   `V` is a constructed type `C<V~1~…V~k~>` and `U` is a constructed type `C<U~1~…U~k~>`

    If any of these cases apply then an *exact inference* is made from each `U~i~` to the corresponding `V~i~`.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Lower-bound inferences

A *lower-bound inference from* a type `U` *to* a type `V` is made as follows:

-   If `V` is one of the *unfixed* `X~i~` then `U` is added to the set of lower bounds for `X~i~`.

-   Otherwise, if `V` is the type `V~1~?` and `U` is the type `U~1~?` then a lower bound inference is made from `U~1~` to `V~1~`.

-   Otherwise, sets `U~1~…U~k~` and `V~1~…V~k~` are determined by checking if any of the following cases apply:

<!-- -->

-   `V` is an array type `V~1~[…]`and `U` is an array type `U~1~[…]`of the same rank

-   `V` is one of `IEnumerable<V~1~>`, `ICollection<V~1~>`, `IReadOnlyList<V~1~>>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<V~1~>` or `IList<V~1~>` and `U` is a single-dimensional array type `U~1~[]`

-   `V` is a constructed `class`, `struct`, `interface` or `delegate` type `C<V~1~…V~k~>` and there is a unique type `C<U~1~…U~k~>` such that `U` (or, if `U` is a type `parameter`, its effective base class or any member of its effective interface set) is identical to, `inherits` from (directly or indirectly), or implements (directly or indirectly) `C<U~1~…U~k~>`.

-   (The “uniqueness” restriction means that in the case interface `C<T>{} class U: C<X>, C<Y>{}`, then no inference is made when inferring from `U` to `C<T>` because `U~1~` could be `X` or `Y`.)

    If any of these cases apply then an inference is made from each `U~i~` to the corresponding `V~i~` as follows:

-   If `U~i~` is not known to be a reference type then an *exact inference* is made

-   Otherwise, if `U` is an array type then a *lower-bound inference* is made

-   Otherwise, if `V` is `C<V~1~…V~k~>` then inference depends on the `i-th` type parameter of `C`:

<!-- -->

-   If it is covariant then a *lower-bound inference* is made.

-   If it is contravariant then an *upper-bound inference* is made.

-   If it is invariant then an *exact inference* is made.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Upper-bound inferences

An *upper-bound inference from* a type `U` *to* a type `V` is made as follows:

-   If `V` is one of the *unfixed* `X~i~` then `U` is added to the set of upper bounds for `X~i~`.

-   Otherwise, sets `V~1~…V~k~` and `U~1~…U~k~` are determined by checking if any of the following cases apply:

<!-- -->

-   `U` is an array type `U~1~[…]`and `V` is an array type `V~1~[…]`of the same rank

-   `U` is one of `IEnumerable<Ue>`, `ICollection<Ue>`, `IReadOnlyList<Ue>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<Ue>` or `IList<Ue>` and `V` is a single-dimensional array type `Ve[]`

-   `U` is the type `U1?` and `V` is the type `V1?`

-   `U` is constructed class, struct, interface or delegate type `C<U~1~…U~k~>` and `V` is a `class, struct, interface` or `delegate` type which is `identical` to, `inherits` from (directly or indirectly), or implements (directly or indirectly) a unique type `C<V~1~…V~k~>`
	
-   (The “uniqueness” restriction means that if we have interface `C<T>{} class V<Z>: C<X<Z>>, C<Y<Z>>{}`, then no inference is made when inferring from `C<U~1~>` to `V<Q>`. Inferences are not made from `U~1~` to either `X<Q>` or `Y<Q>`.)
	
    If any of these cases apply then an inference is made from each `U~i~` to the corresponding `V~i~` as follows:

-   If `U~i~` is not known to be a reference type then an *exact inference* is made

-   Otherwise, if `V` is an array type then an *upper-bound inference* is made

-   Otherwise, if `U` is `C<U~1~…U~k~>` then inference depends on the `i-th` type parameter of `C`:

<!-- -->

-   If it is covariant then an *upper-bound inference* is made.

-   If it is contravariant then a *lower-bound inference* is made.

-   If it is invariant then an *exact inference* is made.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, no inferences are made.

#### Fixing

An *unfixed* type variable `X~i~` with a set of bounds is *fixed* as follows:

-   The set of *candidate types* `U~j~` starts out as the set of all types in the set of bounds for `X~i~`.

-   We then examine each bound for `X~i~` in turn: For each exact bound U of `X~i~` all types `U~j~` that are not identical to `U` are removed from the candidate set. For each lower bound `U` of `X~i~` all types `U~j~` to which there is *not* an implicit conversion from `U` are removed from the candidate set. For each upper-bound U of `X~i~` all types `U~j~` from which there is *not* an implicit conversion to `U` are removed from the candidate set.

-   If among the remaining candidate types `U~j~` there is a unique type `V` to which there is an implicit conversion from all the other candidate types, then `X~i~` is fixed to `V`.

-   Otherwise, type inference fails.

#### Inferred return type

The inferred return type of an anonymous function `F` is used during type inference and overload resolution. The inferred return type can only be determined for an anonymous function where all parameter types are known, either because they are explicitly given, provided through an anonymous function conversion or inferred during type inference on an enclosing generic method invocation.

The ***inferred effective return type*** is determined as follows:

-   If the body of `F` is an *expression* that has a type, then the inferred effective return type of `F` is the type of that expression.

-   If the body of `F` is a *block* and the set of expressions in the block’s return statements has a best common type `T` (§12.6.3.15), then the inferred effective return type of `F` is `T`.

-   Otherwise, an effective return type cannot be inferred for `F`.

The ***inferred return type*** is determined as follows:

-   If `F` is async and the body of `F` is either an expression classified as nothing (§12.2), or a statement block where no return statements have expressions, the inferred return type is `System.Threading.Tasks.Task`

-   If `F` is async and has an inferred effective return type `T`, the inferred return type is `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<T>`.

-   If `F` is non-async and has an inferred effective return type `T`, the inferred return type is `T`.

-   Otherwise, a return type cannot be inferred for `F`.

\[*Example*: As an example of type inference involving anonymous functions, consider the Select extension method declared in the `System.Linq.Enumerable` class:

```csharp
namespace System.Linq
{
	public static class Enumerable
	{
		public static IEnumerable<TResult> Select<TSource,TResult>(
		this IEnumerable<TSource> source,
		Func<TSource,TResult> selector)
		{
			foreach (TSource element in source) yield return selector(element);
		}
	}
}
```
Assuming the `System.Linq` namespace was imported with a using namespace directive, and given a class Customer with a Name property of type string, the Select method can be used to select the names of a list of customers:

```csharp
List<Customer> customers = GetCustomerList();
IEnumerable<string> names = customers.Select(c => c.Name);
```

The extension method invocation (§12.7.6.3) of Select is processed by rewriting the invocation to a static method invocation:

```csharp
IEnumerable<string> names = Enumerable.Select(customers, c => c.Name);
```

Since type arguments were not explicitly specified, type inference is used to infer the type arguments. First, the customers argument is related to the source parameter, inferring TSource to be Customer. Then, using the anonymous function type inference process described above, `c` is given type Customer, and the expression `c.Name` is related to the return type of the selector parameter, inferring TResult to be string. Thus, the invocation is equivalent to

```csharp
Sequence.Select<Customer,string>(customers, (Customer c) => c.Name)
```

and the result is of type `IEnumerable<string>`.

The following example demonstrates how anonymous function type inference allows type information to “flow” between arguments in a generic method invocation. Given the method:

```csharp
static Z F<X,Y,Z>(X value, Func<X,Y> f1, Func<Y,Z> f2) {
	return f2(f1(value));
}
```

Type inference for the invocation:

```csharp
double seconds = F("1:15:30", s => TimeSpan.Parse(s), t => t.TotalSeconds);
```

proceeds as follows: First, the argument "1:15:30" is related to the value parameter, inferring `X` to be string. Then, the parameter of the first anonymous `function, s,` is given the inferred type string, and the expression `TimeSpan.Parse(s)` is related to the return type of `f1`, inferring `Y` to be `System.TimeSpan`. Finally, the parameter of the second anonymous `function, t`, is given the inferred type `System.TimeSpan`, and the expression `t.TotalSeconds` is related to the return type of `f2`, inferring `Z` to be double. Thus, the result of the invocation is of type double. *end example*\]

#### Type inference for conversion of method groups

Similar to calls of generic methods, type inference shall also be applied when a method group `M` containing a generic method is converted to a given delegate type `D` (§11.8). Given a method

```csharp
T~r~ M<X~1~…X~n~>(T~1~ x~1~ … T~m~ x~m~)
```

and the method group `M` being assigned to the delegate type `D` the task of type inference is to find type arguments `S~1~…S~n~` so that the expression:

```csharp
M<S~1~…S~n~>
```

becomes compatible (§20.2) with `D`.

Unlike the type inference algorithm for generic method calls, in this case, there are only argument *types*, no argument *expressions*. In particular, there are no anonymous functions and hence no need for multiple phases of inference.

Instead, all `X~i~` are considered *unfixed*, and a *lower-bound inference* is made *from* each argument type `U~j~` of `D` *to* the corresponding parameter type `T~j~` of `M`. If for any of the `X~i~` no bounds were found, type inference fails. Otherwise, all `X~i~` are *fixed* to corresponding `S~i~`, which are the result of type inference.

#### Finding the best common type of a set of expressions

In some cases, a common type needs to be inferred for a set of expressions. In particular, the element types of implicitly typed arrays and the return types of anonymous functions with *block* bodies are found in this way.

The best common type for a set of expressions `E~1~…E~m~` is determined as follows:

-   A new *unfixed* type variable `X` is introduced.

-   For each expression `Ei` an *output type inference* (§12.6.3.7) is performed from it to `X`.

-   `X` is *fixed* (§12.6.3.12), if possible, and the resulting type is the best common type.

-   Otherwise inference fails.


> [!NOTE]
>  Intuitively this inference is equivalent to calling a method

```csharp
void M<X>(X x~1~ … X x~m~)
```

with the `E~i~` as arguments and inferring `X`. 

### Overload resolution

#### General

Overload resolution is a binding-time mechanism for selecting the best function member to invoke given an argument list and a set of candidate function members. Overload resolution selects the function member to invoke in the following distinct contexts within C#:

-   Invocation of a method named in an *invocation-expression* (§12.7.6).

-   Invocation of an instance constructor named in an *object-creation-expression* (§12.7.11.2).

-   Invocation of an indexer accessor through an *element-access* (§12.7.7).

-   Invocation of a predefined or user-defined operator referenced in an expression (§12.4.4 and §12.4.5).

Each of these contexts defines the set of candidate function members and the list of arguments in its own unique way. For instance, the set of candidates for a method invocation does not include methods marked override (§12.5), and methods in a base class are not candidates if any method in a derived class is applicable (§12.7.6.2).

Once the candidate function members and the argument list have been identified, the selection of the best function member is the same in all cases:

-   First, the set of candidate function members is reduced to those function members that are applicable with respect to the given argument list (§12.6.4.2). If this reduced set is empty, a compile-time error occurs.

-   Then, the best function member from the set of applicable candidate function members is located. If the set contains only one function member, then that function member is the best function member. Otherwise, the best function member is the one function member that is better than all other function members with respect to the given argument list, provided that each function member is compared to all other function members using the rules in §12.6.4.3. If there is not exactly one function member that is better than all other function members, then the function member invocation is ambiguous and a binding-time error occurs.

The following subclauses define the exact meanings of the terms ***applicable function member*** and ***better function member***.

#### Applicable function member

A function member is said to be an ***applicable function member*** with respect to an argument list `A` when all of the following are true:

-   Each argument in `A` corresponds to a parameter in the function member declaration as described in §12.6.2.2, at most one argument corresponds to each parameter, and any parameter to which no argument corresponds is an optional parameter.

-   For each argument in `A`, the parameter-passing mode of the argument is identical to the parameter-passing mode of the corresponding parameter, and

<!-- -->

-   for a value parameter or a parameter array, an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from the argument expression to the type of the corresponding parameter, or

-   for a ref or out parameter, there is an identity conversion between the type of the argument expression and the type of the corresponding parameter

For a function member that includes a parameter array, if the function member is applicable by the above rules, it is said to be applicable in its ***normal form***. If a function member that includes a parameter array is not applicable in its normal form, the function member might instead be applicable in its ***expanded form***:

-   The expanded form is constructed by replacing the parameter array in the function member declaration with zero or more value parameters of the element type of the parameter array such that the number of arguments in the argument list `A` matches the total number of parameters. If `A` has fewer arguments than the number of fixed parameters in the function member declaration, the expanded form of the function member cannot be constructed and is thus not applicable.

-   Otherwise, the expanded form is applicable if for each argument in `A` the parameter-passing mode of the argument is identical to the parameter-passing mode of the corresponding parameter, and

<!-- -->

-   for a fixed value parameter or a value parameter created by the expansion, an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from the argument expression to the type of the corresponding parameter, or

-   for a ref or out parameter, the type of the argument expression is identical to the type of the corresponding parameter.

#### Better function member

For the purposes of determining the better function member, a stripped-down argument list `A` is constructed containing just the argument expressions themselves in the order they appear in the original argument list.

Parameter lists for each of the candidate function members are constructed in the following way:

-   The expanded form is used if the function member was applicable only in the expanded form.

-   Optional parameters with no corresponding arguments are removed from the parameter list

-   The parameters are reordered so that they occur at the same position as the corresponding argument in the argument list.

Given an argument list `A` with a set of argument expressions { `E1, E2, …, EN` } and two applicable function members `Mp` and `Mq` with parameter types { `P1, P2, …, Pn` } and { `Q1, Q2, …, Qn` }, `Mp` is defined to be a ***better function member*** than `Mq` if

-   for each argument, the implicit conversion from `E~X~` to `Q~X~` is not better than the implicit conversion from `E~X~` to `P~X~`, and

-   for at least one argument, the conversion from `E~X~` to `P~X~` is better than the conversion from `E~X~` to `Q~X~`.

In case the parameter type sequences {`P1`, `P2`, …, `Pn`} and {`Q1`, `Q2`, …, `Qn`} are equivalent (i.e., each `Pi` has an identity conversion to the corresponding `Qi`), the following tie-breaking rules are applied, in order, to determine the better function member.

-   If `M~P~` is a non-generic method and `M~Q~` is a generic method, then `M~P~` is better than `M~Q~`.

-   Otherwise, if `M~P~` is applicable in its normal form and `M~Q~` has a params array and is applicable only in its expanded form, then `M~P~` is better than `M~Q~`.

-   Otherwise, if both methods have params arrays and are applicable only in their expanded forms, and if the params array of `M~P~` has fewer elements than the params array of `M~Q~`, then `M~P~` is better than `M~Q~`.

-   Otherwise, if `Mp` has more specific parameter types than `Mq`, then `Mp` is better than `Mq`. Let {`R1`, `R2`, …, `Rn`} and {`S1`, `S2`, …, `Sn`} represent the uninstantiated and unexpanded parameter types of `Mp` and `Mq`. `Mp’s` parameter types are more specific than `Mq’s` if, for each parameter, `Rx` is not less specific than `Sx`, and, for at least one parameter, `Rx` is more specific than `Sx`:

<!-- -->

-   A type parameter is less specific than a non-type parameter.

-   Recursively, a constructed type is more specific than another constructed type (with the same number of type arguments) if at least one type argument is more specific and no type argument is less specific than the corresponding type argument in the other.

-   An array type is more specific than another array type (with the same number of dimensions) if the element type of the first is more specific than the element type of the second.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise if one member is a non-lifted operator and the other is a lifted operator, the non-lifted one is better.

-   If neither function member was found to be better, and all parameters of `Mp` have a corresponding argument whereas default arguments need to be substituted for at least one optional parameter in `Mq`, then `Mp` is better than `Mq`. Otherwise, no function member is better.

#### Better conversion from expression

Given an implicit conversion `C1` that converts from an expression `E` to a type `T1`, and an implicit conversion `C2` that converts from an expression `E` to a type `T2`, `C1` is a ***better conversion*** than `C2` if at least one of the following holds:

-   `E` has a type `S` and an identity conversion exists from `S` to `T~1~` but not from `S` to `T~2~`

-   `E` is not an anonymous function and `T~1~` is a better conversion target than `T~2~` (§12.6.4.6)

-   `E` is an anonymous function, `T1` is either a delegate type `D1` or an expression tree type Expression`<D1>`, `T2` is either a delegate type `D2` or an expression tree type Expression`<D2>` and one of the following holds:

<!-- -->

-   `D~1~` is a better conversion target than `D~2~`

-   `D~1~` and `D~2~` have identical parameter lists, and one of the following holds:

<!-- -->

-   `D1` has a return type `Y1`, and `D2` has a return type `Y2`, an inferred return type `X` exists for `E` in the context of that parameter list (§12.6.3.13), and the conversion from `X` to `Y1` is better than the conversion from `X` to `Y2`

-   `E` is async, `D1` has a return type Task`<Y1>`, and `D2` has a return type Task`<Y>`, an inferred return type Task`<X>` exists for `E` in the context of that parameter list (§12.6.3.13), and the conversion from `X` to `Y1` is better than the conversion from `X` to `Y2`

-   `D~1~` has a return type `Y`, and `D~2~` is void returning

#### Better conversion from type

Given a conversion `C1` that converts from a type `S` to a type `T1`, and a conversion `C2` that converts from a type `S` to a type `T2`, `C1` is a ***better conversion*** than `C2` if at least one of the following holds:

-   An identity conversion exists from `S` to `T~1~` but not from `S` to `T~2~`

-   `T~1~` is a better conversion target than `T~2~` (§12.6.4.6)

#### Better conversion target

Given two different types `T1` and `T2`, `T1` is a better conversion target than `T2` if at least one of the following holds:

-   An implicit conversion from `T1` to `T2` exists, and no implicit conversion from `T2` to `T1` exists

-   `T~1~` is a signed integral type and `T~2~` is an unsigned integral type. Specifically:

<!-- -->

-   `T1` is `sbyte` and `T2` is `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, or `ulong`

-   `T1` is `short` and `T2` is `ushort`, `uint`, or `ulong`

-   `T1` is `int` and `T2` is `uint`, or `ulong`

-   `T1` is `long` and `T2` is `ulong`

#### Overloading in generic classes


> [!NOTE]
>  While signatures as declared shall be unique (§9.6), it is possible that substitution of type arguments results in identical signatures. In such a situation, overload resolution will pick the most specific (§12.6.4.3) of the original signatures (before substitution of type arguments), if it exists, and otherwise report an error. 

\[*Example*: The following examples show overloads that are valid and invalid according to this rule:

```csharp
interface I1<T> {…}

interface I2<T> {…}

class G1<U>
{
	int F1(U u); // Overload resulotion for G<int>.F1
	int F1(int i); // will pick non-generic

	void F2(I1<U> a); // Valid overload
	void F2(I2<U> a);
}

class G2<U,V>
{
	void F3(U u, V v); // Valid, but overload resolution for
	void F3(V v, U u); // G2<int,int>.F3 will fail

	void F4(U u, I1<V> v); // Valid, but overload resolution for
	void F4(I1<V> v, U u); // G2<I1<int>,int>.F4 will fail

	void F5(U u1, I1<V> v2); // Valid overload
	void F5(V v1, U u2);

	void F6(ref U u); // valid overload
	void F6(out V v);
}
```

*end example*\]

### Compile-time checking of dynamic member invocation

Even though overload resolution of a dynamically bound operation takes place at run-time, it is sometimes possible at compile-time to know the list of function members from which an overload will be chosen:

-   For a delegate invocation (§12.7.6.4), the list is a single function member with the same parameter list as the *delegate-type* of the invocation

-   For a method invocation (§12.7.6.2) on a type, or on a value whose static type is not dynamic, the set of accessible methods in the method group is known at compile-time.

-   For an object creation expression (§12.7.11.2) the set of accessible constructors in the type is known at compile-time.

-   For an indexer access (§12.7.7.3) the set of accessible indexers in the receiver is known at compile-time.

In these cases a limited compile-time check is performed on each member in the known set of function members, to see if it can be known for certain never to be invoked at run-time. For each function member `F` a modified parameter and argument list are constructed:

-   First, if `F` is a generic method and type arguments were provided, then those are substituted for the type parameters in the parameter list. However, if type arguments were not provided, no such substitution happens.

-   Then, any parameter whose type is open (i.e., contains a type parameter; see §9.4.3) is elided, along with its corresponding parameter(s).

For `F` to pass the check, all of the following shall hold:

-   The modified parameter list for `F` is applicable to the modified argument list in terms of §12.6.4.2.

-   All constructed types in the modified parameter list satisfy their constraints (§9.4.5).

-   If the type parameters of `F` were substituted in the step above, their constraints are satisfied.

-   If `F` is a static method, the method group shall not have resulted from a *member-access* whose receiver is known at compile-time to be a variable or value.

-   If `F` is an instance method, the method group shall not have resulted from a *member-access* whose receiver is known at compile-time to be a type.

    If no candidate passes this test, a compile-time error occurs.

### Function member invocation

#### General

This subclause describes the process that takes place at run-time to invoke a particular function member. It is assumed that a binding-time process has already determined the particular member to invoke, possibly by applying overload resolution to a set of candidate function members.

For purposes of describing the invocation process, function members are divided into two categories:

-   Static function members. These are static methods, static property accessors, and user-defined operators. Static function members are always non-virtual.

-   Instance function members. These are instance methods, instance constructors, instance property accessors, and indexer accessors. Instance function members are either non-virtual or virtual, and are always invoked on a particular instance. The instance is computed by an instance expression, and it becomes accessible within the function member as this (§12.7.8). For an instance constructor, the instance expression is taken to be the newly allocated object.

The run-time processing of a function member invocation consists of the following steps, where `M` is the function member and, if `M` is an instance member, `E` is the instance expression:

-   If `M` is a static function member:

<!-- -->

-   The argument list is evaluated as described in §12.6.2.

-   `M` is invoked.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, if the type of `E` is a value-type `V`, and `M` is declared or overridden in `V`:

<!-- -->

-   `E` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, then no further steps are executed. For an instance constructor, this evaluation consists of allocating storage (typically from an execution stack) for the new object. In this case `E` is classified as a variable.

-   If `E` is not classified as a variable, then a temporary local variable of `E’s` type is created and the value of `E` is assigned to that variable. `E` is then reclassified as a reference to that temporary local variable. The temporary variable is accessible as this within `M`, but not in any other way. Thus, only when `E` is a true variable is it possible for the caller to observe the changes that `M` makes to this.

-   The argument list is evaluated as described in §12.6.2.

-   `M` is invoked. The variable referenced by `E` becomes the variable referenced by this.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise:

<!-- -->

-   `E` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, then no further steps are executed.

-   The argument list is evaluated as described in §12.6.2.

-   If the type of `E` is a *value-type*, a boxing conversion (§11.2.8) is performed to convert `E` to a *class-type*, and `E` is considered to be of that *class-type* in the following steps. If the *value-type* is an *enum-type*, the *class-type* is `System.Enum;` otherwise, it is `System.ValueType`.

-   The value of `E` is checked to be valid. If the value of `E` is null, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   The function member implementation to invoke is determined:

<!-- -->

-   If the binding-time type of `E` is an interface, the function member to invoke is the implementation of `M` provided by the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`. This function member is determined by applying the interface mapping rules (§18.6.5) to determine the implementation of `M` provided by the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`.

-   Otherwise, if `M` is a virtual function member, the function member to invoke is the implementation of `M` provided by the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`. This function member is determined by applying the rules for determining the most derived implementation (§15.6.4) of `M` with respect to the run-time type of the instance referenced by `E`.

-   Otherwise, `M` is a non-virtual function member, and the function member to invoke is `M` itself.

<!-- -->

-   The function member implementation determined in the step above is invoked. The object referenced by `E` becomes the object referenced by this.

[[[[[#_Ref450460073 .anchor](#_Ref450460073 .anchor)][#_Ref420058031 .anchor](#_Ref420058031 .anchor)][#_Ref370969443 .anchor](#_Ref370969443 .anchor)][#_Toc505589836 .anchor](#_Toc505589836 .anchor)][#_Toc501035407 .anchor](#_Toc501035407 .anchor)The result of the invocation of an instance constructor (§12.7.11.2) is the value created. The result of the invocation of any other function member is the value, if any, returned (§13.10.5) from its body.

#### Invocations on boxed instances

A function member implemented in a *value-type* can be invoked through a boxed instance of that *value-type* in the following situations:

-   When the function member is an override of a method inherited from type *class-type* and is invoked through an instance expression of that *class-type*. 

> [!NOTE]
>  The *class-type* will always be one of `System.Object`, `System.ValueType` or `System.Enum`. 

-   When the function member is an implementation of an interface function member and is invoked through an instance expression of an *interface-type*.

-   When the function member is invoked through a delegate.

In these situations, the boxed instance is considered to contain a variable of the *value-type*, and this variable becomes the variable referenced by this within the function member invocation. 

> [!NOTE]
>  In particular, this means that when a function member is invoked on a boxed instance, it is possible for the function member to modify the value contained in the boxed instance. 

## Primary expressions

### General

Primary expressions include the simplest forms of expressions.

[#Grammar_primary_expression .anchor](#Grammar_primary_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
primary-expression:
	primary-no-array-creation-expression
	array-creation-expression
```

[#Grammar_primary_no_array_creation_expres .anchor](#Grammar_primary_no_array_creation_expres .anchor)

```ANTLR
primary-no-array-creation-expression:
	literal
	simple-name
	parenthesized-expression
	member-access
	invocation-expression
	element-access
	this-access
	base-access
	post-increment-expression
	post-decrement-expression
	object-creation-expression
	delegate-creation-expression
	anonymous-object-creation-expression
	typeof-expression
	sizeof-expression
	checked-expression
	unchecked-expression
	default-value-expression
	anonymous-method-expression
```

Primary expressions are divided between *array-creation-expression*s and *primary-no-array-creation-expression*s. Treating *array-creation-expression* in this way, rather than listing it along with the other simple expression forms, enables the grammar to disallow potentially confusing code such as

```csharp
object o = new int[3][1];
```

which would otherwise be interpreted as

```csharp
object o = (new int[3])[1];
```

### Literals

A *primary-expression* that consists of a *literal* (§7.4.5) is classified as a value.[#_Ref451236352 .anchor](#_Ref451236352 .anchor)

### Simple names

#### General

A *simple-name* consists of an identifier, optionally followed by a type argument list:

[#Grammar_simple_name .anchor](#Grammar_simple_name .anchor)
```ANTLR
simple-name:
	identifier type-argument-list~opt~
```

A *simple-name* is either of the form `I` or of the form `I<A1, …, Ak>`, where `I` is a single identifier and `<A1, …, Ak>` is an optional *type-argument-list*. When no *type-argument-list* is specified, consider `K` to be zero. The *simple-name* is evaluated and classified as follows:

-   If `K` is zero and the *simple-name* appears within a *block* and if the *block*’s (or an enclosing *block*’s) local variable declaration space (§8.3) contains a local variable, parameter or constant with name `I`, then the *simple-name* refers to that local variable, parameter or constant and is classified as a variable or value.

-   If `K` is zero and the *simple-name* appears within a generic method declaration but outside the *attributes* of its *method-header,* and if that declaration includes a type parameter with name `I`, then the *simple-name* refers to that type parameter.

-   Otherwise, for each instance type `T` (§15.3.2), starting with the instance type of the immediately enclosing type declaration and continuing with the instance type of each enclosing class or struct declaration (if any):

<!-- -->

-   If `K` is zero and the declaration of `T` includes a type parameter with name `I`, then the *simple-name* refers to that type parameter.

-   Otherwise, if a member lookup (§12.5) of `I` in `T` with `K` type arguments produces a match:

<!-- -->

-   If `T` is the instance type of the immediately enclosing class or struct type and the lookup identifies one or more methods, the result is a method group with an associated instance expression of this. If a type argument list was specified, it is used in calling a generic method (§12.7.6.2).

-   Otherwise, if `T` is the instance type of the immediately enclosing class or struct type, if the lookup identifies an instance member, and if the reference occurs within the *block* of an instance constructor, an instance method, or an instance accessor (§12.2.1), the result is the same as a member access (§12.7.5) of the form `this.I`. This can only happen when `K` is zero.

-   Otherwise, the result is the same as a member access (§12.7.5) of the form `T.I` or `T.I<A~1~, …, A~K~>`. In this case, it is a binding-time error for the *simple-name* to refer to an instance member.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, for each namespace `N`, starting with the namespace in which the *simple-name* occurs, continuing with each enclosing namespace (if any), and ending with the global namespace, the following steps are evaluated until an entity is located:

<!-- -->

-   If `K` is zero and `I` is the name of a namespace in `N`, then:

<!-- -->

-   If the location where the *simple-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N` and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with a namespace or type, then the *simple-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.

-   Otherwise, the *simple-name* refers to the namespace named `I` in `N`.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, if `N` contains an accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then:

<!-- -->

-   If `K` is zero and the location where the *simple-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N` and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with a namespace or type, then the *simple-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.

-   Otherwise, the *namespace-or-type-name* refers to the type constructed with the given type arguments.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, if the location where the *simple-name* occurs is enclosed by a namespace declaration for `N`:

<!-- -->

-   If `K` is zero and the namespace declaration contains an *extern-alias-directive* or *using-alias-directive* that associates the name `I` with an imported namespace or type, then the *simple-name* refers to that namespace or type.

-   Otherwise, if the namespaces imported by the *using-namespace-directive*s of the namespace declaration contain exactly one type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *simple-name* refers to that type constructed with the given type arguments.

-   Otherwise, if the namespaces imported by the *using-namespace-directive*s of the namespace declaration contain more than one type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the *simple-name* is ambiguous and a compile-time error occurs.


> [!NOTE]
>  This entire step is exactly parallel to the corresponding step in the processing of a *namespace-or-type-name* (§8.8). 

-   Otherwise, the *simple-name* is undefined and a compile-time error occurs.

#### Invariant meaning in blocks

For each occurrence of a given identifier as a full *simple-name* (without a type argument list) in an expression or declarator, within the local variable declaration space (§8.3) immediately enclosing that occurrence, every other occurrence of the same identifier as a full *simple-name* in an expression or declarator shall refer to the same entity. 
> [!NOTE]
>  This rule ensures that the meaning of a name is always the same within a given block, switch block, for-, foreach- or using-statement, or anonymous function.

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
class Test
{
	double x;

	void F(bool b) {
		x = 1.0;
		if (b) {
			int x;
			x = 1;
		}
	}
}
```

results in a compile-time error because `X` refers to different entities within the outer block (the extent of which includes the nested block in the if statement). In contrast, the example

```csharp
class Test
{
	double x;

	void F(bool b) {
		if (b) {
		x = 1.0;
		}
		else {
			int x;
			x = 1;
		}
	}
}
```

is permitted because the name `X` is never used in the outer block. *end example*\]


> [!NOTE]
>  The rule of invariant meaning applies only to simple names. It is perfectly valid for the same identifier to have one meaning as a simple name and another meaning as right operand of a member access (§12.7.5). \[*Example*:

```csharp
struct Point
{
	int x, y;

	public Point(int x, int y) {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	}
}
```

The example above illustrates a common pattern of using the names of fields as parameter names in an instance constructor. In the example, the simple names `x` and `y` refer to the parameters, but that does not prevent the member access expressions `this.x` and `this.y` from accessing the fields. *end example*\]

### Parenthesized expressions

A *parenthesized-expression* consists of an *expression* enclosed in parentheses.

[#Grammar_parenthesized_expression .anchor](#Grammar_parenthesized_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
parenthesized-expression:
	( expression )
```

A *parenthesized-expression* is evaluated by evaluating the *expression* within the parentheses. If the *expression* within the parentheses denotes a namespace or type, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, the result of the *parenthesized-expression* is the result of the evaluation of the contained *expression*.

### Member access

#### General

A *member-access* consists of a *primary-expression*, a *predefined-type*, or a *qualified-alias-member*, followed by a “.” token, followed by an *identifier*, optionally followed by a *type-argument-list*.

[#Grammar_member_access .anchor](#Grammar_member_access .anchor)

```ANTLR
member-access:
	primary-expression . identifier type-argument-list~opt~
	predefined-type . identifier type-argument-list~opt
	~qualified-alias-member . identifier type-argument-list~opt~
```
[#Grammar_predefined_type .anchor](#Grammar_predefined_type .anchor)

```ANTLR
predefined-type: one of
	bool byte char decimal double float int long
	object sbyte short string uint ulong ushort
```
The *qualified-alias-member* production is defined in §14.8.

A *member-access* is either of the form `E.I` or of the form `E.I<A1, …, Ak>`, where `E` is a *primary-expression*, *predefined-type* or *qualified-alias-member,* `I` is a single identifier, and `<A1, …, Ak>` is an optional *type-argument-list*. When no *type-argument-list* is specified, consider `K` to be zero.

A *member-access* with a *primary-expression* of type dynamic is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compiler classifies the member access as a property access of type dynamic. The rules below to determine the meaning of the *member-access* are then applied at run-time, using the run-time type instead of the compile-time type of the *primary-expression*. If this run-time classification leads to a method group, then the member access shall be the *primary-expression* of an *invocation-expression*.

The *member-access* is evaluated and classified as follows:

-   If `K` is zero and `E` is a namespace and `E` contains a nested namespace with name `I`, then the result is that namespace.

-   Otherwise, if `E` is a namespace and `E` contains an accessible type having name `I` and `K` type parameters, then the result is that type constructed with the given type arguments.

-   If `E` is classified as a type, if `E` is not a type parameter, and if a member lookup (§12.5) of `I` in `E` with `K` type parameters produces a match, then `E.I` is evaluated and classified as follows: 

> [!NOTE]
> When the result of such a member lookup is a method group and `K` is zero, the method group can contain methods having type parameters. This allows such methods to be considered for type argument inferencing.

<!-- -->

-   If I identifies a type, then the result is that type constructed with any given type arguments.

-   If I identifies one or more methods, then the result is a method group with no associated instance expression.

-   If I identifies a static property, then the result is a property access with no associated instance expression.

-   If I identifies a static field:

<!-- -->

-   If the field is readonly and the reference occurs outside the static constructor of the class or struct in which the field is declared, then the result is a value, namely the value of the static field `I` in `E`.

-   Otherwise, the result is a variable, namely the static field `I` in `E`.

<!-- -->

-   If I identifies a static event:

<!-- -->

-   If the reference occurs within the class or struct in which the event is declared, and the event was declared without *event-accessor-declarations* (§15.8.1), then `E.I` is processed exactly as if `I` were a static field.

-   Otherwise, the result is an event access with no associated instance expression.

<!-- -->

-   If `I` identifies a constant, then the result is a value, namely the value of that constant.

-   If `I` identifies an enumeration member, then the result is a value, namely the value of that enumeration member.

-   Otherwise, `E.I` is an invalid member reference, and a compile-time error occurs.

<!-- -->

-   If `E` is a property access, indexer access, variable, or value, the type of which is `T`, and a member lookup (§12.5) of `I` in `T` with `K` type arguments produces a match, then `E.I` is evaluated and classified as follows:

<!-- -->

-   First, if `E` is a property or indexer access, then the value of the property or indexer access is obtained (§12.2.2) and E is reclassified as a value.

-   If `I` identifies one or more methods, then the result is a method group with an associated instance expression of `E`.

-   If `I` identifies an instance property, then the result is a property access with an associated instance expression of `E` and an associated type that is the type of the property. If `T` is a class type, the associated type is picked from the first declaration or override of the property found when starting with `T`, and searching through its base classes.

-   If `T` is a *class-type* and `I` identifies an instance field of that *class-type*:

<!-- -->

-   If the value of `E` is null, then a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown.

-   Otherwise, if the field is readonly and the reference occurs outside an instance constructor of the class in which the field is declared, then the result is a value, namely the value of the field `I` in the object referenced by `E`.

-   Otherwise, the result is a variable, namely the field `I` in the object referenced by `E`.

<!-- -->

-   If T is a *struct-type* and `I` identifies an instance field of that *struct-type*:

<!-- -->

-   If `E` is a value, or if the field is readonly and the reference occurs outside an instance constructor of the struct in which the field is declared, then the result is a value, namely the value of the field `I` in the struct instance given by `E`.

-   Otherwise, the result is a variable, namely the field `I` in the struct instance given by `E`.

<!-- -->

-   If `I` identifies an instance event:

<!-- -->

-   If the reference occurs within the class or struct in which the event is declared, and the event was declared without *event-accessor-declarations* (§15.8.1), and the reference does not occur as the left-hand side of `a +=` or `-=` operator, then `E.I` is processed exactly as if `I` was an instance field.

-   Otherwise, the result is an event access with an associated instance expression of `E`.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, an attempt is made to process `E.I` as an extension method invocation (§12.7.6.3). If this fails, `E.I` is an invalid member reference, and a binding-time error occurs.

#### Identical simple names and type names

In a member access of the form `E.I`, if `E` is a single identifier, and if the meaning of `E` as a *simple-name* (§12.7.3) is a constant, field, property, local variable, or parameter with the same type as the meaning of `E` as a *type-name* (§8.8.1), then both possible meanings of `E` are permitted. The member lookup of `E.I` is never ambiguous, since `I` shall necessarily be a member of the type `E` in both cases. In other words, the rule simply permits access to the static members and nested types of `E` where a compile-time error would otherwise have occurred. \[*Example*:

```csharp
struct Color
{
	public static readonly Color White = new Color(…);
	public static readonly Color Black = new Color(…);

	public Color Complement() {…}
}

class A
	{
	public *Color* Color; // Field Color of type Color

	void F() {
		Color = *Color*.Black; // Refs Color.Black static member
		Color = Color.Complement(); // Invokes Complement() on Color fld
	}

	static void G() {
		*Color* c = *Color*.White; // Refs Color.White static member
	}
}
```

Within the `A` class, those occurrences of the Color identifier that reference the Color type are underlined, and those that reference the Color field are not underlined. *end example*\]

### Invocation expressions

#### General

An *invocation-expression* is used to invoke a method.

[#Grammar_invocation_expression .anchor](#Grammar_invocation_expression .anchor)invocation-expression:
primary-expression *(* argument-list~opt~ *)*

An *invocation-expression* is dynamically bound (§12.3.3) if at least one of the following holds:

-   The *primary-expression* has compile-time type dynamic.

-   At least one argument of the optional *argument-list* has compile-time type dynamic.

In this case, the compiler classifies the *invocation-expression* as a value of type dynamic. The rules below to determine the meaning of the *invocation-expression* are then applied at run-time, using the run-time type instead of the compile-time type of those of the *primary-expression* and arguments that have the compile-time type dynamic. If the *primary-expression* does not have compile-time type dynamic, then the method invocation undergoes a limited compile-time check as described in §12.6.5.

The *primary-expression* of an *invocation-expression* shall be a method group or a value of a *delegate-type*. If the *primary-expression* is a method group, the *invocation-expression* is a method invocation (§12.7.6.2). If the *primary-expression* is a value of a *delegate-type*, the *invocation-expression* is a delegate invocation (§12.7.6.4). If the *primary-expression* is neither a method group nor a value of a *delegate-type*, a binding-time error occurs.

The optional *argument-list* (§12.6.2) provides values or variable references for the parameters of the method.

The result of evaluating an *invocation-expression* is classified as follows:

-   If the *invocation-expression* invokes a method or delegate that returns void, the result is nothing. An expression that is classified as nothing is permitted only in the context of a *statement-expression* (§13.7) or as the body of a *lambda-expression* (§12.16). Otherwise a binding-time error occurs.

-   Otherwise, the result is a value, with an associated type of the return type of the method or delegate. If the invocation is of an instance method, and the receiver is of a class type `T`, the associated type is picked from the first declaration or override of the method found when starting with `T` and searching through its base classes.

#### Method invocations

For a method invocation, the *primary-expression* of the *invocation-expression* shall be a method group. The method group identifies the one method to invoke or the set of overloaded methods from which to choose a specific method to invoke. In the latter case, determination of the specific method to invoke is based on the context provided by the types of the arguments in the *argument-list*.

The binding-time processing of a method invocation of the form `M(A)`, where `M` is a method group (possibly including a *type-argument-list*), and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

-   The set of candidate methods for the method invocation is constructed. For each method `F` associated with the method group `M`:

<!-- -->

-   If `F` is non-generic, `F` is a candidate when:

<!-- -->

-   `M` has no type argument list, and

-   `F` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2).

<!-- -->

-   If `F` is generic and `M` has no type argument list, `F` is a candidate when:

<!-- -->

-   Type inference (§12.6.3) succeeds, inferring a list of type arguments for the call, and

-   Once the inferred type arguments are substituted for the corresponding method type parameters, all constructed types in the parameter list of `F` satisfy their constraints (§9.4.5), and the parameter list of `F` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2)

<!-- -->

-   If `F` is generic and `M` includes a type argument list, `F` is a candidate when:

<!-- -->

-   `F` has the same number of method type parameters as were supplied in the type argument list, and

-   Once the type arguments are substituted for the corresponding method type parameters, all constructed types in the parameter list of `F` satisfy their constraints (§9.4.5), and the parameter list of `F` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2).

<!-- -->

-   The set of candidate methods is reduced to contain only methods from the most derived types: For each method `C.F` in the set, where `C` is the type in which the method `F` is declared, all methods declared in a base type of `C` are removed from the set. Furthermore, if `C` is a class type other than object, all methods declared in an interface type are removed from the set. 

> [!NOTE]
>  This latter rule only has an effect when the method group was the result of a member lookup on a type parameter having an effective base class other than object and a non-empty effective interface set.

-   If the resulting set of candidate methods is empty, then further processing along the following steps are abandoned, and instead an attempt is made to process the invocation as an extension method invocation (§12.7.6.3). If this fails, then no applicable methods exist, and a binding-time error occurs.

-   The best method of the set of candidate methods is identified using the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. If a single best method cannot be identified, the method invocation is ambiguous, and a binding-time error occurs. When performing overload resolution, the parameters of a generic method are considered after substituting the type arguments (supplied or inferred) for the corresponding method type parameters.

-   ***Final validation*** of the chosen best method is performed:

<!-- -->

-   The method is validated in the context of the method group: If the best method is a static method, the method group shall have resulted from a *simple-name* or a *member-access* through a type. If the best method is an instance method, the method group shall have resulted from a *simple-name*, a *member-access* through a variable or value, or a *base-access*. If neither of these requirements is true, a binding-time error occurs.

-   If the best method is a generic method, the type arguments (supplied or inferred) are checked against the constraints (§9.4.5) declared on the generic method. If any type argument does not satisfy the corresponding constraint(s) on the type parameter, a binding-time error occurs.

Once a method has been selected and validated at binding-time by the above steps, the actual run-time invocation is processed according to the rules of function member invocation described in §12.6.6.


> [!NOTE]
>  The intuitive effect of the resolution rules described above is as follows: To locate the particular method invoked by a method invocation, start with the type indicated by the method invocation and proceed up the inheritance chain until at least one applicable, accessible, non-override method declaration is found. Then perform type inference and overload resolution on the set of applicable, accessible, non-override methods declared in that type and invoke the method thus selected. If no method was found, try instead to process the invocation as an extension-method invocation.

#### Extension method invocations

In a method invocation (§12.6.6.2) of one of the forms

```csharp
expr . identifier ( )
expr . identifier ( args )
expr . identifier < typeargs > ( )
expr . identifier < typeargs > ( args )
```
if the normal processing of the invocation finds no applicable methods, an attempt is made to process the construct as an extension method invocation. If *expr* or any of the *args* has compile-time type dynamic, extension methods will not apply.

The objective is to find the best *type-name* `C`, so that the corresponding static method invocation can take place:

```csharp
C . identifier ( expr )

C . identifier ( expr , args )

C . identifier < typeargs > ( expr )

C . identifier < typeargs > ( expr , args )
```

An extension method `C~i~.M~j~` is ***eligible*** if:

-   `C~i~` is a non-generic, non-nested class

-   The name of `M~j~` is *identifier*

-   `M~j~` is accessible and applicable when applied to the arguments as a static method as shown above

-   An implicit identity, reference or boxing conversion exists from *expr* to the type of the first parameter of `M~j~`.

The search for `C` proceeds as follows:

-   Starting with the closest enclosing namespace declaration, continuing with each enclosing namespace declaration, and ending with the containing compilation unit, successive attempts are made to find a candidate set of extension methods:

<!-- -->

-   If the given namespace or compilation unit directly contains non-generic type declarations `C~i~` with eligible extension methods `M~j~`, then the set of those extension methods is the candidate set.

-   If namespaces imported by using namespace directives in the given namespace or compilation unit directly contain non-generic type declarations `C~i~` with eligible extension methods `M~j~`, then the set of those extension methods is the candidate set.

<!-- -->

-   If no candidate set is found in any enclosing namespace declaration or compilation unit, a compile-time error occurs.

-   Otherwise, overload resolution is applied to the candidate set as described in §12.6.4. If no single best method is found, a compile-time error occurs.

-   `C` is the type within which the best method is declared as an extension method.

Using `C` as a target, the method call is then processed as a static method invocation (§12.6.6). 

> [!NOTE]
>  Unlike an instance method invocation, no exception is thrown when *expr* evaluates to a null reference. Instead, this null value is passed to the extension method as it would be via a regular static method invocation. It is up to the extension method implementation to decide how to respond to such a call.

The preceding rules mean that instance methods take precedence over extension methods, that extension methods available in inner namespace declarations take precedence over extension methods available in outer namespace declarations, and that extension methods declared directly in a namespace take precedence over extension methods imported into that same namespace with a using namespace directive. \[*Example*:

```csharp
public static class E
{
	public static void F(this object obj, int i) { }

	public static void F(this object obj, string s) { }
}

class A { }

class B
{
	public void F(int i) { }
}

class C
{
	public void F(object obj) { }
}

class X
{
	static void Test(A a, B b, C c) {
		a.F(1); // E.F(object, int)
		a.F("hello"); // E.F(object, string)

		b.F(1); // B.F(int)
		b.F("hello"); // E.F(object, string)

		c.F(1); // C.F(object)
		c.F("hello"); // C.F(object)
	}
}
```

In the example, `B’s` method takes precedence over the first extension method, and `C’s` method takes precedence over both extension methods.

```csharp
public static class C
{
	public static void F(this int i) { Console.WriteLine("C.F({0})", i); }
	public static void G(this int i) { Console.WriteLine("C.G({0})", i); }
	public static void H(this int i) { Console.WriteLine("C.H({0})", i); }
}

namespace N1
{
public static class D
	{
		public static void F(this int i) { Console.WriteLine("D.F({0})", i); }
		public static void G(this int i) { Console.WriteLine("D.G({0})", i); }
	}
}

namespace N2
{
	using N1;

	public static class E
	{
		public static void F(this int i) { Console.WriteLine("E.F({0})", i); }
	}

	class Test
	{
		static void Main(string\[\] args)
		{
			1.F();
			2.G();
			3.H();
		}
	}
}
```

The output of this example is:

```csharp
E.F(1)
D.G(2)
C.H(3)
```

`D.G` takes precendece over `C.G`, and `E.F` takes precedence over both `D.F` and `C.F`. *end example*\]

#### Delegate invocations

For a delegate invocation, the *primary-expression* of the *invocation-expression* shall be a value of a *delegate-type*. Furthermore, considering the *delegate-type* to be a function member with the same parameter list as the *delegate-type*, the *delegate-type* shall be applicable (§12.6.4.2) with respect to the *argument-list* of the *invocation-expression*.

The run-time processing of a delegate invocation of the form `D(A)`, where `D` is a *primary-expression* of a *delegate-type* and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

-   [#_Ref450456451 .anchor](#_Ref450456451 .anchor)D is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.

-   The argument list `A` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.

-   The value of `D` is checked to be valid. If the value of `D` is null, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   Otherwise, `D` is a [#_Hlt501435622 .anchor](#_Hlt501435622 .anchor)reference to a delegate instance. Function member invocations (§12.6.6) are performed on each of the callable entities in the invocation list of the delegate. For callable entities consisting of an instance and instance method, the instance for the invocation is the instance contained in the callable entity.

See §20.6 for details of multiple invocation lists without parameters.

### Element access

#### General

An *element-access* consists of a *primary-no-array-creation-expression*, followed by a “\[” token, followed by an *argument-list*, followed by a “\]” token. The *argument-list* consists of one or more *argument*s, separated by commas.

[#Grammar_element_access .anchor](#Grammar_element_access .anchor)

```ANTLR
element-access:
	primary-no-array-creation-expression [ argument-list ]
```

The *argument-list* of an *element-access* is not allowed to contain ref or out arguments.

An *element-access* is dynamically bound (§12.3.3) if at least one of the following holds:

-   The *primary-no-array-creation-expression* has compile-time type dynamic.

-   At least one expression of the *argument-list* has compile-time type dynamic and the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* does not have an array type.

In this case, the compiler classifies the *element-access* as a value of type dynamic. The rules below to determine the meaning of the *element-access* are then applied at run-time, using the run-time type instead of the compile-time type of those of the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* and *argument-list* expressions which have the compile-time type dynamic. If the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* does not have compile-time type dynamic, then the element access undergoes a limited compile-time check as described in §12.6.5.

If the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of an *element-access* is a value of an *array-type*, the *element-access* is an array access (§12.7.7.2). Otherwise, the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* shall be a variable or value of a class, struct, or interface type that has one or more indexer members, in which case the *element-access* is an indexer access (§12.7.7.3).

#### Array access

For an array access, the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of the *element-access* shall be a value of an *array-type*. Furthermore, the *argument-list* of an array access is not allowed to contain named arguments.The number of expressions in the *argument-list* shall be the same as the rank of the *array-type*, and each expression shall be of type `int, uint, long, ulong,` or shall be implicitly convertible to one or more of these types.

The result of evaluating an array access is a variable of the element type of the `array`, namely the `array` element selected by the value(s) of the expression(s) in the *argument-list*.

The run-time processing of an array access of the form `P[A]`, where `P` is a *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of an *array-type* and `A` is an *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

-   [#_Ref450735501 .anchor](#_Ref450735501 .anchor)`P` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.

-   The index expressions of the *argument-list* are evaluated in order, from left to right. Following evaluation of each index expression, an implicit conversion (§11.2) to one of the following types is performed: `int, uint, long, ulong`. The first type in this list for which an implicit conversion exists is chosen. For instance, if the index expression is of type short then an implicit conversion to int is performed, since implicit conversions from short to int and from short to long are possible. If evaluation of an index expression or the subsequent implicit conversion causes an exception, then no further index expressions are evaluated and no further steps are executed.

-   The value of `P` is checked to be valid. If the value of `P` is `null`, a `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   The value of each expression in the *argument-list* is checked against the actual bounds of each dimension of the `array` instance referenced by `P`. If one or more values are out of range, a `System.IndexOutOfRangeException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   The location of the `array` element given by the index expression(s) is computed, and this location becomes the result of the `array` access.

#### Indexer access

For an indexer access, the *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of the *element-access* shall be a variable or value of a `class`, `struct`, or `interface type`, and this type shall implement one or more indexers that are applicable with respect to the *argument-list* of the *element-access*.

The binding-time processing of an indexer access of the form `P[A]`, where `P` is a *primary-no-array-creation-expression* of a class, struct, or interface type `T`, and `A` is an *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

-   The set of indexers provided by `T` is constructed. The set consists of all indexers declared in `T` or a base type of `T` that are not override declarations and are accessible in the current context (§8.5).

-   The set is reduced to those indexers that are applicable and not hidden by other indexers. The following rules are applied to each indexer `S.I` in the set, where `S` is the type in which the indexer `I` is declared:

<!-- -->

-   If `I` is not applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2), then `I` is removed from the set.

-   If `I` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2), then all indexers declared in a base type of `S` are removed from the set.

-   If `I` is applicable with respect to `A` (§12.6.4.2) and `S` is a class type other than object, all indexers declared in an interface are removed from the set.

<!-- -->

-   If the resulting set of candidate indexers is empty, then no applicable indexers exist, and a binding-time error occurs.

-   The best indexer of the set of candidate indexers is identified using the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. If a single best indexer cannot be identified, the indexer access is ambiguous, and a binding-time error occurs.

-   The index expressions of the *argument-list* are evaluated in order, from left to right. The result of processing the indexer access is an expression classified as an indexer access. The indexer access expression references the indexer determined in the step above, and has an associated instance expression of `P` and an associated argument list of `A`, and an associated type that is the type of the indexer. If `T` is a class type, the associated type is picked from the first declaration or override of the indexer found when starting with `T` and searching through its base classes.

Depending on the context in which it is used, an indexer access causes invocation of either the *get-accessor* or the *set-accessor* of the indexer. If the indexer access is the target of an assignment, the *set-accessor* is invoked to assign a new value (§12.18.2). In all other cases, the *get-accessor* is invoked to obtain the current value (§12.2.2).

### This access

A *this-access* consists of the keyword this.

[#Grammar_this_access .anchor](#Grammar_this_access .anchor)
```ANTLR
this-access:
	this
```

A *this-access* is permitted only in the *block* of an instance constructor, an instance method, an instance accessor (§12.2.1), or a finalizer. It has one of the following meanings:

-   When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance constructor of a class, it is classified as a value. The type of the value is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the class within which the usage occurs, and the value is a reference to the object being constructed.

-   When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance method or instance accessor of a class, it is classified as a value. The type of the value is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the class within which the usage occurs, and the value is a reference to the object for which the method or accessor was invoked.

-   When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance constructor of a struct, it is classified as a variable. The type of the variable is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the struct within which the usage occurs, and the variable represents the struct being constructed.

<!-- -->

-   If the constructor declaration has no constructor initializer, the this variable behaves exactly the same as an out parameter of the struct type. In particular, this means that the variable shall be definitely assigned in every execution path of the instance constructor.

-   Otherwise, the this variable behaves exactly the same as a ref parameter of the struct type. In particular, this means that the variable is considered initially assigned.

<!-- -->

-   When this is used in a *primary-expression* within an instance method or instance accessor of a struct, it is classified as a variable. The type of the variable is the instance type (§15.3.2) of the struct within which the usage occurs.

<!-- -->

-   If the method or accessor is not an iterator (§15.14) or async function (§15.15), the this variable represents the struct for which the method or accessor was invoked, and behaves exactly the same as a ref parameter of the struct type.

-   If the method or accessor is an iterator or async function, the this variable represents a *copy* of the struct for which the method or accessor was invoked, and behaves exactly the same as a *value* parameter of the struct type.

Use of this in a *primary-expression* in a context other than the ones listed above is a compile-time error. In particular, it is not possible to refer to this in a static method, a static property accessor, or in a *variable-initializer* of a field declaration.

### Base access

A *base-access* consists of the keyword base followed by either a “.” token and an identifier and optional *type-argument-list* or an *argument-list* enclosed in square brackets:

[#Grammar_base_access .anchor](#Grammar_base_access .anchor)

```ANTLR
base-access:
	base . identifier type-argument-list~opt~
	base [ argument-list ]
```

A *base-access* is used to access base class members that are hidden by similarly named members in the current class or struct. A *base-access* is permitted only in the *block* of an instance constructor, an instance method, an instance accessor (§12.2.1), or a finalizer. When `base.I` occurs in a class or struct, I shall denote a member of the base class of that class or struct. Likewise, when base`[E]` occurs in a class, an applicable indexer shall exist in the base class.

At binding-time, *base-access* expressions of the form `base.I` and `base[E]` are evaluated exactly as if they were written `((B)this).I` and `((B)this)[E]`, where `B` is the base class of the class or struct in which the construct occurs. Thus, `base.I` and `base[E]` correspond to `this.I` and `this[E]`, except this is viewed as an instance of the base class.

When a *base-access* references a virtual function member (a method, property, or indexer), the determination of which function member to invoke at run-time (§12.6.6) is changed. The function member that is invoked is determined by finding the most derived implementation (§15.6.4) of the function member with respect to `B` (instead of with respect to the run-time type of this, as would be usual in a non-base access). Thus, within an override of a virtual function member, a *base-access* can be used to invoke the inherited implementation of the function member. If the function member referenced by a *base-access* is abstract, a binding-time error occurs.


> [!NOTE]
>  Unlike this, base is not an expression in itself. It is a keyword only used in the context of a *base-access* or a *constructor-initializer* (§15.11.2).

### Postfix increment and decrement operators

[#Grammar_post_increment_expression .anchor](#Grammar_post_increment_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
post-increment-expression:
	primary-expression ++[#Grammar_post_decrement_expression .anchor](#Grammar_post_decrement_expression .anchor)
```
post-decrement-expression:
primary-expression *--*

The operand of a postfix increment or decrement operation shall be an expression classified as a variable, a property access, or an indexer access. The result of the operation is a value of the same type as the operand.

If the *primary-expression* has the compile-time type dynamic then the operator is dynamically bound (§12.3.3), the *post-increment-expression* or *post-decrement-expression* has the compile-time type dynamic and the following rules are applied at run-time using the run-time type of the *primary-expression*.

If the operand of a postfix increment or decrement operation is a property or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have both a get and a set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

Unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. Predefined `++` and `--` operators exist for the following types: `sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, decimal`, and any `enum` type. The predefined `++` operators return the value produced by adding `1` to the operand, and the predefined `--` operators return the value produced by subtracting `1` from the operand. In a checked context, if the result of this addition or subtraction is outside the range of the result type and the result type is an integral type or enum type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.

There shall be an implicit conversion from the return type of the selected unary operator to the type of the *primary-expression*, otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a postfix increment or decrement operation of the form `x++` or `x--` consists of the following steps:

-   If `x` is classified as a variable:

<!-- -->

-   `x` is evaluated to produce the variable.

-   The value of `x` is saved.

-   The saved value of `x` is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and the operator is invoked with this value as its argument.

-   The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `X` and stored in the location given by the earlier evaluation of `x`.

-   The saved value of `x` becomes the result of the operation.

<!-- -->

-   If `x` is classified as a property or indexer access:

<!-- -->

-   The instance expression (if `x` is not static) and the argument list (if `x` is an indexer access) associated with `x` are evaluated, and the results are used in the subsequent get and set accessor invocations.

-   The get accessor of `x` is invoked and the returned value is saved.

-   The saved value of `x` is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and the operator is invoked with this value as its argument.

-   The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `x` and the set accessor of `x` is invoked with this value as its value argument.

-   The saved value of `x` becomes the result of the operation.

The `++` and `--` operators also support prefix notation (§12.8.6). Typically, the result of `x++` or `x--` is the value of `X` *before* the operation, whereas the result of `++x` or `--x` is the value of `X` *after* the operation. In either case, `x` itself has the same value after the operation.

An operator `++` or operator `--` implementation can be invoked using either postfix or prefix notation. It is not possible to have separate operator implementations for the two notations.

### The new operator

#### General

The new operator is used to create new instances of types.

There are three forms of new expressions:

-   Object creation expressions and anonymous object creation expressions are used to create new instances of class types and value types.

-   Array creation expressions are used to create new instances of array types.

-   Delegate creation expressions are used to obtain instances of delegate types.

The new operator implies creation of an instance of a type, but does not necessarily imply allocation of memory. In particular, instances of value types require no additional memory beyond the variables in which they reside, and no allocations occur when new is used to create instances of value types.


> [!NOTE]
>  Delegate creation expressions do not always create new instances. When the expression is processed in the same way as a method group conversion (§11.8) or an anonymous function conversion (§11.7) this may result in an existing delegate instance being reused.

#### Object creation expressions

An *object-creation-expression* is used to create a new instance of a *class-type* or a *value-type*.

[#Grammar_object_creation_expression .anchor](#Grammar_object_creation_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
object-creation-expression:
	new type ( argument-list~opt~ ) object-or-collection-initializer~opt~
	new type object-or-collection-initializer
```

[[#Grammar_object_or_collection_initialize .anchor](#Grammar_object_or_collection_initialize .anchor)][#Grammar_object_or_collectiion_initialize .anchor](#Grammar_object_or_collectiion_initialize .anchor)

```ANTLR
object-or-collection-initializer:
	object-initializer
	collection-initializer
```
The *type* of an *object-creation-expression* shall be a *class-type*, a *value-type*, or a *type-parameter*. The *type* cannot be an abstract or static *class-type*.

The optional *argument-list* (§12.6.2) is permitted only if the *type* is a *class-type* or a *struct-type*.

An object creation expression can omit the constructor argument list and enclosing parentheses provided it includes an object initializer or collection initializer. Omitting the constructor argument list and enclosing parentheses is equivalent to specifying an empty argument list.

Processing of an object creation expression that includes an object initializer or collection initializer consists of first processing the instance constructor and then processing the member or element initializations specified by the object initializer (§12.7.11.3) or collection initializer (§12.7.11.4).

If any of the arguments in the optional argument-list has the compile-time type dynamic then the *object-creation-expression* is dynamically bound (§12.3.3) and the following rules are applied at run-time using the run-time type of those arguments of the *argument-list* that have the compile-time type dynamic. However, the object creation undergoes a limited compile-time check as described in §12.6.5.

The binding-time processing of an *object-creation-expression* of the form new `T(A)`, where `T` is a *class-type*, or a *value*-*type*, and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

-   If `T` is a *value-type* and `A` is not present:

<!-- -->

-   The *object-creation-expression* is a default constructor invocation. The result of the *object-creation-expression* is a value of type `T`, namely the default value for `T` as defined in §9.3.3.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, if `T` is a *type-parameter* and `A` is not present:

<!-- -->

-   If no value type constraint or constructor constraint (§15.2.5) has been specified for `T`, a binding-time error occurs.

-   The result of the *object-creation-expression* is a value of the run-time type that the type parameter has been bound to, namely the result of invoking the default constructor of that type. The run-time type may be a reference type or a value type.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, if `T` is a *class-type* or a *struct-type*:

<!-- -->

-   If `T` is an abstract or static *class-type*, a compile-time error occurs.

-   The instance constructor to invoke is determined using the overload resolution rules of §12.6.4. The set of candidate instance constructors consists of all accessible instance constructors declared in `T`, which are applicable with respect to A (§12.6.4.2). If the set of candidate instance constructors is empty, or if a single best instance constructor cannot be identified, a binding-time error occurs.

-   The result of the *object-creation-expression* is a value of type `T`, namely the value produced by invoking the instance constructor determined in the step above.

-   Otherwise, the *object-creation-expression* is invalid, and a binding-time error occurs.

Even if the *object-creation-expression* is dynamically bound, the compile-time type is still `T`.

The run-time processing of an *object-creation-expression* of the form new `T(A)`, where `T` is *class-type* or a *struct-type* and `A` is an optional *argument-list*, consists of the following steps:

-   If `T` is a *class-type*:

<!-- -->

-   A new instance of class `T` is allocated. If there is not enough memory available to allocate the new instance, a `System.OutOfMemoryException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   All fields of the new instance are initialized to their default values (§10.3).

-   The instance constructor is invoked according to the rules of function member invocation (§12.6.6). A reference to the newly allocated instance is automatically passed to the instance constructor and the instance can be accessed from within that constructor as this.

<!-- -->

-   If `T` is a *struct-type*:

<!-- -->

-   An instance of type `T` is created by allocating a temporary local variable. Since an instance constructor of a *struct-type* is required to definitely assign a value to each field of the instance being created, no initialization of the temporary variable is necessary.

-   The instance constructor is invoked according to the rules of function member invocation (§12.6.6). A reference to the newly allocated instance is automatically passed to the instance constructor and the instance can be accessed from within that constructor as this.

#### Object initializers

An ***object initializer*** specifies values for zero or more fields or properties of an object.

```
An object initializer consists of a sequence of member initializers, enclosed by `{` and `}` tokens and separated by commas. Each member initializer shall name an accessible field or property of the object being initialized, followed by an equals sign and an expression or an object initializer or collection initializer. It is an error for an object initializer to include more than one member initializer for the same field or property. It is not possible for the object initializer to refer to the newly created object it is initializing.

A member initializer that specifies an expression after the equals sign is processed in the same way as an assignment (§12.18.2) to the field or property.

A member initializer that specifies an object initializer after the equals sign is a ***nested object initializer***, i.e., an initialization of an embedded object. Instead of assigning a new value to the field or property, the assignments in the nested object initializer are treated as assignments to members of the field or property. Nested object initializers cannot be applied to properties with a value type, or to read-only fields with a value type.

A member initializer that specifies a collection initializer after the equals sign is an initialization of an embedded collection. Instead of assigning a new collection to the field or property, the elements given in the initializer are added to the collection referenced by the field or property. The field or property shall be of a collection type that satisfies the requirements specified in §12.7.11.4.

\[*Example*:The following class represents a point with two coordinates:

```csharp
public class Point
{
	int x, y;

	public int X { get { return x; } set { x = value; } }
	public int Y { get { return y; } set { y = value; } }
}
```

An instance of Point can be created and initialized as follows:

```csharp
Point a = new Point { X = 0, Y = 1 };
```

which has the same effect as

```csharp
Point __a = new Point();
__a.X = 0;
__a.Y = 1;
Point a = __a;
```

where `__a` is an otherwise invisible and inaccessible temporary variable. The following class represents a rectangle created from two points:


```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
	Point p1, p2;

	public Point P1 { get { return p1; } set { p1 = value; } }
	public Point P2 { get { return p2; } set { p2 = value; } }
}
```

An instance of Rectangle can be created and initialized as follows:

```csharp
Rectangle r = new Rectangle {
	P1 = new Point { X = 0, Y = 1 },
	P2 = new Point { X = 2, Y = 3 }
};
```

which has the same effect as

```csharp
Rectangle __r = new Rectangle();
Point __p1 = new Point();
__p1.X = 0;
__p1.Y = 1;
__r.P1 = __p1;
Point __p2 = new Point();
__p2.X = 2;
__p2.Y = 3;
__r.P2 = __p2;
Rectangle r = __r;
```
where `__r`, `__p1` and `__p2` are temporary variables that are otherwise invisible and inaccessible.

If Rectangle’s constructor allocates the two embedded Point instances

```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
	Point p1 = new Point();
	Point p2 = new Point();

	public Point P1 { get { return p1; } }
	public Point P2 { get { return p2; } }
}
```

the following construct can be used to initialize the embedded Point instances instead of assigning new instances:

```csharp
Rectangle r = new Rectangle {
	P1 = { X = 0, Y = 1 },
	P2 = { X = 2, Y = 3 }
};
```

which has the same effect as

```csharp
Rectangle __r = new Rectangle();
__r.P1.X = 0;
__r.P1.Y = 1;
__r.P2.X = 2;
__r.P2.Y = 3;
Rectangle r = __r;
```

#### Collection initializers

A collection initializer specifies the elements of a collection.

[#Grammar_collection_initializer .anchor](#Grammar_collection_initializer .anchor)
```ANTLR
collection-initializer:
	{ element-initializer-list }
	{ element-initializer-list , }
```

[#Grammar_element_initializer_list .anchor](#Grammar_element_initializer_list .anchor)
```ANTLR
element-initializer-list:
	element-initializer

	{ expression-list }
```

[#Grammar_expression_list .anchor](#Grammar_expression_list .anchor)
```ANTLR
expression-list:
	expression
	expression-list , expression
```

A collection initializer consists of a sequence of element initializers, enclosed by `{` and `}` tokens and separated by commas. Each element initializer specifies an element to be added to the collection object being initialized, and consists of a list of expressions enclosed by { and } tokens and separated by commas. A single-expression element initializer can be written without braces, but cannot then be an assignment expression, to avoid ambiguity with member initializers. The *non-assignment-expression* production is defined in §12.19.

\[*Example*:

The following is an example of an object creation expression that includes a collection initializer:

```csharp
List<int> digits = new List<int> { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
```

*end example*\]

The collection object to which a collection initializer is applied shall be of a type that implements `System.Collections.IEnumerable` or a compile-time error occurs. For each specified element in order, the collection initializer invokes an Add method on the target object with the expression list of the element initializer as argument list, applying normal overload resolution for each invocation. Thus, the collection object shall contain an applicable Add method for each element initializer.

\[*Example*:The following class represents a contact with a name and a list of phone numbers:

```csharp
public class Contact
	{
	string name;
	List<string> phoneNumbers = new List<string>();
	
	public string Name { get { return name; } set { name = value; } }
	
	public List<string> PhoneNumbers { get { return phoneNumbers; } }
	}
```

A List&lt;Contact&gt; can be created and initialized as follows:

```csharp	
var contacts = new List<Contact> {
	new Contact {
		Name = "Chris Smith",
		PhoneNumbers = { "206-555-0101", "425-882-8080" }
	},
	new Contact {
		Name = "Bob Harris",
		PhoneNumbers = { "650-555-0199" }
	}
};
```
which has the same effect as

```csharp
var __clist = new List&lt;Contact&gt;();
Contact __c1 = new Contact();
__c1.Name = "Chris Smith";
__c1.PhoneNumbers.Add("206-555-0101");
__c1.PhoneNumbers.Add("425-882-8080");
__clist.Add(__c1);
Contact __c2 = new Contact();
__c2.Name = "Bob Harris";
__c2.PhoneNumbers.Add("650-555-0199");
__clist.Add(__c2);
var contacts = __clist;
```

where `__clist`, `__c1` and `__c2` are temporary variables that are otherwise invisible and inaccessible. *end example*\]

#### Array creation expressions

An *array-creation-expression* is used to create a new instance of an *array-type*.

[#Grammar_array_creation_expression .anchor](#Grammar_array_creation_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
array-creation-expression:
	new non-array-type [ expression-list ] rank-specifiers~opt~ array-initializer~opt~
	new array-type array-initializer
	new rank-specifier array-initializer
```

An array creation expression of the first form allocates an array instance of the type that results from deleting each of the individual expressions from the expression list. \[*Example*: The array creation expression new int`[10,20]` produces an array instance of type `int[,],` and the array creation expression new `int[10][,]` produces an array instance of type `int[][,]`. *end example*\] Each expression in the expression list shall be of type int, uint, long, or ulong, or implicitly convertible to one or more of these types. The value of each expression determines the length of the corresponding dimension in the newly allocated array instance. Since the length of an array dimension shall be nonnegative, it is a compile-time error to have a constant expression with a negative value, in the expression list.

Except in an unsafe context (§23.2), the layout of arrays is unspecified.

If an array creation expression of the first form includes an array initializer, each expression in the expression list shall be a constant and the rank and dimension lengths specified by the expression list shall match those of the array initializer.

In an array creation expression of the second or third form, the rank of the specified array type or rank specifier shall match that of the array initializer. The individual dimension lengths are inferred from the number of elements in each of the corresponding nesting levels of the array initializer. Thus, the expression

```csharp
new int[,] {{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}
```
exactly corresponds to

```csharp
new int[3, 2] {{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}
```

An array creation expression of the third form is referred to as an ***implicitly typed array-creation expression***. It is similar to the second form, except that the element type of the array is not explicitly given, but determined as the best common type (§12.6.3.15) of the set of expressions in the array initializer. For a multidimensional array, i.e., one where the *rank-specifier* contains at least one comma, this set comprises all *expression*s found in nested *array-initializer*s.

Array initializers are described further in §17.7.

The result of evaluating an array creation expression is classified as a value, namely a reference to the newly allocated array instance. The run-time processing of an array creation expression consists of the following steps:

-   The dimension length expressions of the *expression-list* are evaluated in order, from left to right. Following evaluation of each expression, an implicit conversion (§11.2) to one of the following types is performed: `int, uint, long, ulong`. The first type in this list for which an implicit conversion exists is chosen. If evaluation of an expression or the subsequent implicit conversion causes an exception, then no further expressions are evaluated and no further steps are executed.

-   The computed values for the dimension lengths are validated, as follows: If one or more of the values are less than zero, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   An array instance with the given dimension lengths is allocated. If there is not enough memory available to allocate the new instance, a `System.OutOfMemoryException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   All elements of the new array instance are initialized to their default values (§10.3).

-   If the array creation expression contains an array initializer, then each expression in the array initializer is evaluated and assigned to its corresponding array element. The evaluations and assignments are performed in the order the expressions are written in the array initializer—in other words, elements are initialized in increasing index order, with the rightmost dimension increasing first. If evaluation of a given expression or the subsequent assignment to the corresponding array element causes an exception, then no further elements are initialized (and the remaining elements will thus have their default values).

An array creation expression permits instantiation of an array with elements of an array type, but the elements of such an array shall be manually initialized. \[*Example*: The statement

```csharp
int[][] a = new int[100][];
```

creates a single-dimensional array with 100 elements of type int\[\]. The initial value of each element is null. It is not possible for the same array creation expression to also instantiate the sub-arrays, and the statement

```csharp
int[][] a = new int[100][5]; // Error
```
results in a compile-time error. Instantiation of the sub-arrays can instead be performed manually, as in

```csharp
int[][] a = new int[100][];
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) a[i] = new int[5];
```
*end example*\]


> [!NOTE]
>  When an array of arrays has a “rectangular” shape, that is when the sub-arrays are all of the same length, it is more efficient to use a multi-dimensional array. In the example above, instantiation of the array of arrays creates 101 objects—one outer array and 100 sub-arrays. In contrast,

```csharp
int[,] = new int[100, 5];
```

creates only a single object, a two-dimensional array, and accomplishes the allocation in a single statement.

\[*Example*: The following are examples of implicitly typed array creation expressions:

```csharp
var a = new[] { 1, 10, 100, 1000 }; // int[]

var b = new[] { 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 }; // double[]

var c = new[,] { { "hello", null }, { "world", "!" } }; // string[,]

var d = new[] { 1, "one", 2, "two" }; // Error
```

The last expression causes a compile-time error because neither int nor string is implicitly convertible to the other, and so there is no best common type. An explicitly typed array creation expression must be used in this case, for example specifying the type to be object\[\]. Alternatively, one of the elements can be cast to a common base type, which would then become the inferred element type. *end example*\]

Implicitly typed array creation expressions can be combined with anonymous object initializers (§12.7.11.7) to create anonymously typed data structures. \[*Example*:

```csharp
var contacts = new[] {
	new {
		Name = "Chris Smith",
		PhoneNumbers = new[] { "206-555-0101", "425-882-8080" }
	},
	new {
		Name = "Bob Harris",
		PhoneNumbers = new[] { "650-555-0199" }
	}
};
```

*end example*\]

#### Delegate creation expressions

A *delegate-creation-expression* is used to obtain an instance of a *delegate-type*.

[#Grammar_delegate_creation_expression .anchor](#Grammar_delegate_creation_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
delegate-creation-expression:
	new delegate-type ( expression )
```

The argument of a delegate creation expression shall be a method group, an anonymous function, or a value of either the compile-time type dynamic or a *delegate-type*. If the argument is a method group, it identifies the method and, for an instance method, the object for which to create a delegate. If the argument is an anonymous function it directly defines the parameters and method body of the delegate target. If the argument is a value it identifies a delegate instance of which to create a copy.

If the *expression* has the compile-time type dynamic, the *delegate-creation-expression* is dynamically bound (§12.7.11.6), and the rules below are applied at run-time using the run-time type of the *expression*. Otherwise, the rules are applied at compile-time.

The binding-time processing of a *delegate-creation-expression* of the form new `D(E)`, where `D` is a *delegate-type* and `E` is an *expression*, consists of the following steps:

-   If `E` is a method group, the delegate creation expression is processed in the same way as a method group conversion (§11.8) from `E` to `D`.

-   If `E` is an anonymous function, the delegate creation expression is processed in the same way as an anonymous function conversion (§11.7) from `E` to `D`.

-   If `E` is a value, `E` shall be compatible (§20.2) with `D`, and the result is a reference to a newly created delegate with a single-entry invocation list that invokes  `E`.

The run-time processing of a *delegate-creation-expression* of the form new `D(E)`, where `D` is a *delegate-type* and `E` is an *expression*, consists of the following steps:

-   If `E` is a method group, the delegate creation expression is evaluated as a method group conversion (§11.8) from `E` to `D`.

-   If `E` is an anonymous function, the delegate creation is evaluated as an anonymous function conversion from `E` to `D` (§11.7).

-   If `E` is a value of a *delegate-type*:

<!-- -->

-   `E` is evaluated. If this evaluation causes an exception, no further steps are executed.

-   If the value of `E` is null, [#_Hlt515406403 .anchor](#_Hlt515406403 .anchor)a Sys[#_Hlt515848184 .anchor](#_Hlt515848184 .anchor)`tem.NullReferenceException` [#_Hlt505515983 .anchor](#_Hlt505515983 .anchor)is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   A new instance of the delegate type D is allocated. If there is not enough memory available to allocate the new instance, a `System.OutOfMemoryException` is thrown and no further steps are executed.

-   The new delegate instance is initialized with a single-entry invocation list[#_Hlt510925477 .anchor](#_Hlt510925477 .anchor) that invokes `E`.

The invocation list of a delegate is determined when the delegate is instantiated and then remains constant for the entire lifetime of the delegate. In other words, it is not possible to change the target callable entities of a delegate once it has been created. 

> [!NOTE]
>  Remember, when two delegates are combined or one is removed from another, a new delegate results; no existing delegate has its content changed.

It is not possible to create a delegate that refers to a property, indexer, user-defined operator, instance constructor, finalizer, or static constructor.

\[*Example*: As described above, when a delegate is created from a method group, the formal parameter list and return type of the delegate determine which of the overloaded methods to select. In the example

```csharp
delegate double DoubleFunc(double x);

class A
{
	DoubleFunc f = new DoubleFunc(Square);

	static float Square(float x) {
		return x * x;
	}

	static double Square(double x) {
		return x * x;
	}
}
```

the `A.f` field is initialized with a delegate that refers to the second Square method because that method exactly matches the formal parameter list and return type of DoubleFunc. Had the second Square method not been present, a compile-time error would have occurred. *end example*\]

#### Anonymous object creation expressions

An *anonymous-object-creation-expression* is used to create an object of an anonymous type.

[#Grammar_anon_obj_creation_expression .anchor](#Grammar_anon_obj_creation_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
anonymous-object-creation-expression:
	new anonymous-object-initializer
```

[#Grammar_anon_obj_initializer .anchor](#Grammar_anon_obj_initializer .anchor)

anonymous-object-initializer:
	{ member-declarator-list~opt~ }
	{ member-declarator-list , }
```

[#Grammar_member_declarator_list .anchor](#Grammar_member_declarator_list .anchor)
```ANTLR

[#Grammar_member_declarator .anchor](#Grammar_member_declarator .anchor)
```ANTLR
member-declarator:
	simple-name
	member-access
	base-access
	identifier = expression
```

An anonymous object initializer declares an anonymous type and returns an instance of that type. An anonymous type is a nameless class type that inherits directly from object. The members of an anonymous type are a sequence of read-only properties inferred from the anonymous object initializer used to create an instance of the type. Specifically, an anonymous object initializer of the form

```csharp
new { p~1~ = e~1~ , p~2~ = e~2~ , … p~n~ = e~n~ }

declares an anonymous type of the form

class __Anonymous1
{
	private readonly T~1~ f~1~ ;
	private readonly T~2~ f~2~ ;
	…
	private readonly T~n~ f~n~ ;

	public __Anonymous1(T~1~ a~1~, T~2~ a~2~,…, T~n~ a~n~) {
		f~1~ = a~1~ ;
		f~2~ = a~2~ ;
		…
		f~n~ = a~n~ ;
	}

	public T~1~ p~1~ { get { return f~1~ ; } }
	public T~2~ p~2~ { get { return f~2~ ; } }
	…
	public T~n~ p~n~ { get { return f~n~ ; } }

	public override bool Equals(object __o) { … }
	public override int GetHashCode() { … }
}
```

where each `T~x~` is the type of the corresponding expression `e~x~`. The expression used in a member-declarator shall have a type. Thus, it is a compile-time error for an expression in a member-declarator to be null or an anonymous function. It is also a compile-time error for the expression to have an unsafe type.

The names of an anonymous type and of the parameter to its Equals method are automatically generated by the compiler and cannot be referenced in program text.

Within the same program, two anonymous object initializers that specify a sequence of properties of the same names and compile-time types in the same order will produce instances of the same anonymous type.

\[Example: In the example

```csharp
var p1 = new { Name = "Lawnmower", Price = 495.00 };
var p2 = new { Name = "Shovel", Price = 26.95 };
p1 = p2;
```

the assignment on the last line is permitted because p1 and p2 are of the same anonymous type. end example\]

The Equals and GetHashcode methods on anonymous types override the methods inherited from object, and are defined in terms of the Equals and GetHashcode of the properties, so that two instances of the same anonymous type are equal if and only if all their properties are equal.

A member declarator can be abbreviated to a simple name (§12.7.3), a member access (§12.7.5) or a base access (§12.7.9). This is called a projection initializer and is shorthand for a declaration of and assignment to a property with the same name. Specifically, member declarators of the forms

`identifier expr . identifier`

are precisely equivalent to the following, respectively:

`identifer = identifier identifier = expr . identifier`

Thus, in a projection initializer the identifier selects both the value and the field or property to which the value is assigned. Intuitively, a projection initializer projects not just a value, but also the name of the value.

### The typeof operator

The typeof operator is used to obtain the `System.Type` object for a type.

[#Grammar_typeof_expression .anchor](#Grammar_typeof_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
typeof-expression:
	typeof ( type )
	typeof ( unbound-type-name )
	typeof ( void )
```

[#Grammar_unbound_type_name .anchor](#Grammar_unbound_type_name .anchor)
```ANTLR
unbound-type-name:
	identifier generic-dimension-specifier~opt~
	identifier :: identifier generic-dimension-specifier~opt~
	unbound-type-name . identifier generic-dimension-specifier~opt~
```

[#Grammar_generic_dimension_specifier .anchor](#Grammar_generic_dimension_specifier .anchor)

generic-dimension-specifier:
	< commas~opt~ >
```

[#Grammar_commas .anchor](#Grammar_commas .anchor)
```ANTLR
	commas:
	,
	commas ,
```

The first form of typeof-expression consists of a typeof keyword followed by a parenthesized type. The result of an expression of this form is the `System.Type` object for the indicated type. There is only one `System.Type` object for any given type. This means that for a type `T`, `typeof(T) == typeof(T)` is always true. The type cannot be dynamic.

The second form of typeof-expression consists of a typeof keyword followed by a parenthesized unbound-type-name. 

> [!NOTE]
>  An unbound-type-name is very similar to a type-name (§8.8) except that an unbound-type-name contains generic-dimension-specifiers where a type-name contains type-argument-lists. When the operand of a typeof-expression is a sequence of tokens that satisfies the grammars of both unbound-type-name and type-name, namely when it contains neither a generic-dimension-specifier nor a type-argument-list, the sequence of tokens is considered to be a type-name. The meaning of an unbound-type-name is determined as follows:

-   Convert the sequence of tokens to a type-name by replacing each generic-dimension-specifier with a type-argument-list having the same number of commas and the keyword object as each type-argument.

-   Evaluate the resulting type-name, while ignoring all type parameter constraints.

-   The unbound-type-name resolves to the unbound generic type associated with the resulting constructed type (§9.4).

The result of the typeof-expression is the `System.Type` object for the resulting unbound generic type.

The third form of typeof-expression consists of a typeof keyword followed by a parenthesized void keyword. The result of an expression of this form is the `System.Type` object that represents the absence of a type. The type object returned by typeof(void) is distinct from the type object returned for any type. 

> [!NOTE]
>  This special type object is useful in class libraries that allow reflection onto methods in the language, where those methods wish to have a way to represent the return type of any method, including void methods, with an instance of `System.Type`.

The typeof operator can be used on a type parameter. The result is the `System.Type` object for the run-time type that was bound to the type parameter. The typeof operator can also be used on a constructed type or an unbound generic type (§9.4.4). The `System.Type` object for an unbound generic type is not the same as the `System.Type` object of the instance type (§15.3.2). The instance type is always a closed constructed type at run-time so its `System.Type` object depends on the run-time type arguments in use. The unbound generic type, on the other hand, has no type arguments, and yields the same `System.Type` object regardless of runtime type arguments.

\[Example: The example

```csharp
using System;

class X<T>
{
	public static void PrintTypes() {
		Type[] t = {
			typeof(int),
			typeof(System.Int32),
			typeof(string),
			typeof(double[]),
			typeof(void),
			typeof(T),
			typeof(X<T>),
			typeof(X<X<T>>),
			typeof(X<>)
		};
		for (int i = 0; i < t.Length; i++) {
			Console.WriteLine(t[i]);
		}
	}
}

class Test
{
	static void Main() {
		X<int>.PrintTypes();
	}
}

produces the following output:

System.Int32
System.Int32
System.String
System.Double[]
System.Void
System.Int32
X`1[System.Int32]
X`1[X`1[System.Int32]]
X`1[T]
```

Note that int and `System.Int32` are the same type.

The result of typeof(X&lt;&gt;) does not depend on the type argument but the result of typeof(X&lt;T&gt;) does. end example\]

### The sizeof operator

The sizeof operator returns the number of 8-bit bytes occupied by a variable of a given type. The type specified as an operand to sizeof shall be an unmanaged-type (§23.3).

For certain predefined types the sizeof operator yields a constant int value as shown in the table below:

  ----------------- --------
  Expression        Result
  sizeof(sbyte)     1
  sizeof(byte)      1
  sizeof(short)     2
  sizeof(ushort)    2
  sizeof(int)       4
  sizeof(uint)      4
  sizeof(long)      8
  sizeof(ulong)     8
  sizeof(char)      2
  sizeof(float)     4
  sizeof(double)    8
  sizeof(bool)      1
  sizeof(decimal)   16
  ----------------- --------

For an enum type `T`, the result of the expression `sizeof(T)` is a constant value equal to the size of its underlying type, as given above. For all other operand types, the sizeof operator is specified in §23.6.9.

### The checked and unchecked operators

The checked and unchecked operators are used to control the overflow-checking context for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.

[#Grammar_checked_expression .anchor](#Grammar_checked_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
checked-expression:
	checked ( expression )
```

[#Grammar_unchecked_expression .anchor](#Grammar_unchecked_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
unchecked-expression:
	unchecked ( expression )
```

The checked operator evaluates the contained expression in a checked context, and the unchecked operator evaluates the contained expression in an unchecked context. A checked-expression or unchecked-expression corresponds exactly to a parenthesized-expression (§12.7.4), except that the contained expression is evaluated in the given overflow checking context.

The overflow checking context can also be controlled through the checked and unchecked statements (§13.12).

The following operations are affected by the overflow checking context established by the checked and unchecked operators and statements:

-   The predefined `++` and `--` operators (§12.7.10 and §12.8.6), when the operand is of an integral or enumtype.

-   The predefined `-` unary operator (§12.8.3), when the operand is of an integral type.

-   The predefined `+, -, \,` and `/` binary operators (§12.9), when both operands are of integral or enumtypes.

-   Explicit numeric conversions (§11.3.2) from one integral or enumtype to another integral or enumtype, or from float or double to an integral or enumtype.

When one of the above operations produces a result that is too large to represent in the destination type, the context in which the operation is performed controls the resulting behavior:

-   In a checked context, if the operation is a constant expression (§12.20), a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, when the operation is performed at run-time, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.

-   In an unchecked context, the result is truncated by discarding any high-order bits that do not fit in the destination type.

For non-constant expressions (§12.20) (expressions that are evaluated at run-time) that are not enclosed by any checked or unchecked operators or statements, the default overflow checking context is unchecked, unless external factors (such as compiler switches and execution environment configuration) call for checked evaluation.

For constant expressions (§12.20) (expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile-time), the default overflow checking context is always checked. Unless a constant expression is explicitly placed in an unchecked context, overflows that occur during the compile-time evaluation of the expression always cause compile-time errors.

The body of an anonymous function is not affected by checked or unchecked contexts in which the anonymous function occurs.

\[Example: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
	static readonly int x = 1000000;
	static readonly int y = 1000000;

	static int F() {
		return checked(x \ y); // Throws OverflowException
	}

	static int G() {
		return unchecked(x \ y); // Returns -727379968
	}

	static int H() {
		return x \ y; // Depends on default
	}
}
```

no compile-time errors are reported since neither of the expressions can be evaluated at compile-time. At run-time, the `F` method throws a `System.OverflowException`, and the `G` method returns –727379968 (the lower 32 bits of the out-of-range result). The behavior of the `H` method depends on the default overflow-checking context for the compilation, but it is either the same as `F` or the same as `G`. end example\]

\[Example: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
	const int x = 1000000;
	const int y = 1000000;

	static int F() {
		return checked(x * y); // Compile-time error, overflow
	}

	static int G() {
		return unchecked(x * y); // Returns -727379968
	}

	static int H() {
		return x * y; // Compile-time error, overflow
	}
}
```

the overflows that occur when evaluating the constant expressions in `F` and `H` cause compile-time errors to be reported because the expressions are evaluated in a checked context. An overflow also occurs when evaluating the constant expression in `G`, but since the evaluation takes place in an unchecked context, the overflow is not reported. end example\]

The checked and unchecked operators only affect the overflow checking context for those operations that are textually contained within the “(” and “)” tokens. The operators have no effect on function members that are invoked as a result of evaluating the contained expression. \[Example: In the following code

```csharp
class Test
{
	static int Multiply(int x, int y) {
		return x * y;
	}

	static int F() {
		return checked(Multiply(1000000, 1000000));
	}
}
```
the use of checked in F does not affect the evaluation of `x * Y` in Multiply, so `x * Y` is evaluated in the default overflow checking context. end example\]

The unchecked operator is convenient when writing constants of the signed integral types in hexadecimal notation. \[Example:

```csharp
class Test
{
	public const int AllBits = unchecked((int)0xFFFFFFFF);

	public const int HighBit = unchecked((int)0x80000000);
}
```

Both of the hexadecimal constants above are of type uint. Because the constants are outside the int range, without the unchecked operator, the casts to int would produce compile-time errors. end example\]


> [!NOTE]
>  The checked and unchecked operators and statements allow programmers to control certain aspects of some numeric calculations. However, the behavior of some numeric operators depends on their operands’ data types. For example, multiplying two decimals always results in an exception on overflow even within an explicitly unchecked construct. Similarly, multiplying two floats never results in an exception on overflow even within an explicitly checked construct. In addition, other operators are never affected by the mode of checking, whether default or explicit.[[[[[[[#_Toc445783008 .anchor](#_Toc445783008 .anchor)][#_Toc511022852 .anchor](#_Toc511022852 .anchor)][#_Toc505664007 .anchor](#_Toc505664007 .anchor)][#_Toc505589861 .anchor](#_Toc505589861 .anchor)][#_Toc503164107 .anchor](#_Toc503164107 .anchor)][#_Toc501035433 .anchor](#_Toc501035433 .anchor)][#_Ref461349814 .anchor](#_Ref461349814 .anchor)

### Default value expressions

A default value expression is used to obtain the default value (§10.3) of a type. Typically a default value expression is used for type parameters, since it might not be known if the type parameter is a value type or a reference type. (No conversion exists from the null literal (§7.4.5.7) to a type parameter unless the type parameter is known to be a reference type (§9.2).)

[#Grammar_default_value_expression .anchor](#Grammar_default_value_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
default-value-expression:
	default ( type )
```

If the type in a default-value-expression evaluates at run-time to a reference type, the result is null converted to that type. If the type in a default-value-expression evaluates at run-time to a value type, the result is the value-type’s default value (§9.3.3).

A default-value-expression is a constant expression (§12.20) if type is a reference type or a type parameter that is known to be a reference type (§9.2). In addition, a default-value-expression is a constant expression if the type is one of the following value types: `sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, decimal, bool,` or any `enumeration` type.

### Anonymous method expressions

An anonymous-method-expression is one of two ways of defining an anonymous function. These are further described in §12.16.

## Unary operators

### General

The `+, -, !, ~, ++, --, cast,` and `await` operators are called the unary operators.

[#Grammar_unary_expression .anchor](#Grammar_unary_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
unary-expression:
	primary-expression
	+ unary-expression
	- unary-expression
	! unary-expression
	\~ unary-expression
	pre-increment-expression
	pre-decrement-expression
	cast-expression
	await-expression
```

If the operand of a unary-expression has the compile-time type dynamic, it is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the unary-expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of the operand.

### Unary plus operator

For an operation of the form `+x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. The predefined unary plus operators are:

```csharp
int operator +(int x);
uint operator +(uint x);
long operator +(long x);
ulong operator +(ulong x);
float operator +(float x);
double operator +(double x);
decimal operator +(decimal x);
```

For each of these operators, the result is simply the value of the operand.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined unary plus operators defined above are also predefined.

### Unary minus operator

For an operation of the form `–x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. The predefined unary minus operators are:

-   Integer negation:

```csharp
int operator –(int x);
long operator –(long x);
```

> The result is computed by subtracting `X` from zero. If the value of `X` is the smallest representable value of the operand type (`−2^31^` for int or `−2^63^` for long), then the mathematical negation of `X` is not representable within the operand type. If this occurs within a checked context, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown; if it occurs within an unchecked context, the result is the value of the operand and the overflow is not reported.
>
> If the operand of the negation operator is of type uint, it is converted to type long, and the type of the result is long. An exception is the rule that permits the int value `−2147483648 (−2^31^)` to be written as a decimal integer literal (§7.4.5.3).
>
> If the operand of the negation operator is of type ulong, a compile-time error occurs. An exception is the rule that permits the long value `−9223372036854775808 (−2^63^)` to be written as a decimal integer literal (§7.4.5.3)

-   Floating-point negation:

```csharp
float operator –(float x);
double operator –(double x);
```

> The result is the value of `X` with its sign inverted. If `x` is `NaN`, the result is also `NaN`.

-   Decimal negation:

```csharp
decimal operator –(decimal x);
```

> The result is computed by subtracting `X` from zero. Decimal negation is equivalent to using the unary minus operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined unary minus operators defined above are also predefined.

### Logical negation operator

For an operation of the form `!x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. Only one predefined logical negation operator exists:

```csharp
bool operator !(bool x);
```

This operator computes the logical negation of the operand: If the operand is `true`, the result is `false`. If the operand is `false`, the result is `true`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined logical negation operator defined above are also predefined.

### Bitwise complement operator

For an operation of the form `~x`, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operand is converted to the parameter type of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. The predefined bitwise complement operators are:

```csharp
int operator ~(int x);
uint operator ~(uint x);
long operator ~(long x);
ulong operator ~(ulong x);
```
For each of these operators, the result of the operation is the bitwise complement of `x`.

Every enumeration type `E` implicitly provides the following bitwise complement operator:

```csharp
E operator ~(E x);
```

The result of evaluating `~x`, where `X` is an expression of an enumeration type `E` with an underlying type `U`, is exactly the same as evaluating `(E)(~(U)x)`, except that the conversion to `E` is always performed as if in an unchecked context (§12.7.14).

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined bitwise complement operators defined above are also predefined.

### Prefix increment and decrement operators

[#Grammar_pre_increment_expression .anchor](#Grammar_pre_increment_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
pre-increment-expression:
	++ unary-expression
```
[#Grammar_pre_decrement_expression .anchor](#Grammar_pre_decrement_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
pre-decrement-expression:
	-- unary-expression
```

The operand of a prefix increment or decrement operation shall be an expression classified as a variable, a property access, or an indexer access. The result of the operation is a value of the same type as the operand.

If the operand of a prefix increment or decrement operation is a property or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have both a get and a set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

Unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. Predefined `++` and `--` operators exist for the following types: `sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, decimal,` and any `enum` type. The predefined `++` operators return the value produced by adding `1` to the operand, and the predefined `--` operators return the value produced by subtracting `1` from the operand. In a checked context, if the result of this addition or subtraction is outside the range of the result type and the result type is an integral type or enum type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown.

There shall be an implicit conversion from the return type of the selected unary operator to the type of the primary-expression, otherwise a compile-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a prefix increment or decrement operation of the form `++x` or `--x` consists of the following steps:

-   If `x` is classified as a variable:

<!-- -->

-   `x` is evaluated to produce the variable.

-   The value of `x` is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and the operator is invoked with this value as its argument.

-   The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `x`. The resulting value is stored in the location given by the evaluation of `x`.

-   and becomes the result of the operation.

<!-- -->

-   If `x` is classified as a property or indexer access:

<!-- -->

-   The instance expression (if `x` is not static) and the argument list (if `x` is an indexer access) associated with `x` are evaluated, and the results are used in the subsequent get and set accessor invocations.

-   The get accessor of `X` is invoked.

-   The value returned by the get accessor is converted to the operand type of the selected operator and operator is invoked with this value as its argument.

-   The value returned by the operator is converted to the type of `x`. The set accessor of `X` is invoked with this value as its value argument.

-   This value also becomes the result of the operation.

The `++` and `--` operators also support postfix notation (§12.7.10). Typically, the result of `x++` or `x--` is the value of `X` before the operation, whereas the result of `++x` or `--x` is the value of `X` after the operation. In either case, `x` itself has the same value after the operation.

An operator `++` or operator `--` implementation can be invoked using either postfix or prefix notation. It is not possible to have separate operator implementations for the two notations.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined prefix increment and decrement operators defined above are also predefined.

### Cast expressions

A cast-expression is used to convert explicitly an expression to a given type.

[#Grammar_cast_expression .anchor](#Grammar_cast_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
cast-expression:
	( type ) unary-expression
```

A cast-expression of the form `(T)E`, where `T` is a type and `E` is a unary-expression, performs an explicit conversion (§11.3) of the value of `E` to type `T`. If no explicit conversion exists from `E` to `T`, a binding-time error occurs. Otherwise, the result is the value produced by the explicit conversion. The result is always classified as a value, even if `E` denotes a variable.

The grammar for a cast-expression leads to certain syntactic ambiguities. \[Example: The expression `(x)–y` could either be interpreted as a cast-expression (a cast of `–y` to type `x`) or as an additive-expression combined with a parenthesized-expression (which computes the value `x – y`). end example\]

To resolve cast-expression ambiguities, the following rule exists: A sequence of one or more tokens (§7.4) enclosed in parentheses is considered the start of a cast-expression only if at least one of the following are true:

-   The sequence of tokens is correct grammar for a type, but not for an expression.

-   The sequence of tokens is correct grammar for a type, and the token immediately following the closing parentheses is the token “\~”, the token “!”, the token “(”, an identifier (§7.4.3), a literal (§7.4.5), or any keyword (§7.4.4) except as and is.

The term “correct grammar” above means only that the sequence of tokens shall conform to the particular grammatical production. It specifically does not consider the actual meaning of any constituent identifiers. \[Example: If `x` and `y` are identifiers, then `x.y` is correct grammar for a type, even if `x.y` doesn’t actually denote a type. end example\]


> [!NOTE]
>  From the disambiguation rule, it follows that, if `x` and `y` are identifiers, `(x)y`, `(x)(y)`, and `(x)(-y)` are cast-expressions, but `(x)-y` is not, even if `x` identifies a type. However, if `x` is a keyword that identifies a predefined type (such as int), then all four forms are cast-expressions (because such a keyword could not possibly be an expression by itself).

### Await expressions

#### General

The await operator is used to suspend evaluation of the enclosing async function until the asynchronous operation represented by the operand has completed.

[#Grammar_await_expression .anchor](#Grammar_await_expression .anchor)
```ANTLR
await-expression:
	await unary-expression
```

An await-expression is only allowed in the body of an async function (§15.15). Within the nearest enclosing async function, an await-expression shall not occur in these places:

-   Inside a nested (non-async) anonymous function

-   In a catch or finally block of a try-statement

-   Inside the block of a lock-statement

-   In an anonymous function conversion to an expression tree type (§11.7.3)

-   In an unsafe context


> [!NOTE]
>  An await-expression cannot occur in most places within a query-expression, because those are syntactically transformed to use non-async lambda expressions.

Inside an async function, await shall not be used as an available-identifier although the verbatim identifier @await may be used. There is therefore no syntactic ambiguity between await-expressions and various expressions involving identifiers. Outside of async functions, await acts as a normal identifier.

The operand of an await-expression is called the task. It represents an asynchronous operation that may or may not be complete at the time the await-expression is evaluated. The purpose of the await operator is to suspend execution of the enclosing async function until the awaited task is complete, and then obtain its outcome.

#### Awaitable expressions

The task of an await expression is required to be awaitable. An expression `t` is awaitable if one of the following holds:

-   `t` is of compile-time type dynamic

-   `t` has an accessible instance or extension method called `GetAwaiter` with no parameters and no type parameters, and a return type `A` for which all of the following hold:

<!-- -->

-   A implements the interface `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.INotifyCompletion` (hereafter known as `INotifyCompletion` for brevity)

-   A has an accessible, readable instance property `IsCompleted` of type bool

-   A has an accessible instance method `GetResult` with no parameters and no type parameters

The purpose of the `GetAwaiter` method is to obtain an awaiter for the task. The type A is called the awaiter type for the await expression.

The purpose of the `IsCompleted` property is to determine if the task is already complete. If so, there is no need to suspend evaluation.

The purpose of the `INotifyCompletion.OnCompleted` method is to sign up a “continuation” to the task; i.e., a delegate (of type `System.Action`) that will be invoked once the task is complete.

The purpose of the `GetResult` method is to obtain the outcome of the task once it is complete. This outcome may be successful completion, possibly with a result value, or it may be an exception which is thrown by the GetResult method.

#### Classification of await expressions

The expression await `t` is classified the same way as the expression `(t).GetAwaiter().GetResult()`. Thus, if the return type of GetResult is void, the await-expression is classified as nothing. If it has a non-void return type `T`, the await-expression is classified as a value of type `T`.

#### Run-time evaluation of await expressions

At run-time, the expression await t is evaluated as follows:

-   An awaiter `a` is obtained by evaluating the expression `(t).GetAwaiter()`.

-   A bool `b` is obtained by evaluating the expression `(a).IsCompleted`.

-   If `b` is `false` then evaluation depends on whether a implements the interface `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ICriticalNotifyCompletion` (hereafter known as `ICriticalNotifyCompletion` for brevity). This check is done at binding time; i.e., at run-time if a has the compile-time type dynamic, and at compile-time otherwise. Let r denote the resumption delegate (§15.15):

<!-- -->

-   If a does not implement `ICriticalNotifyCompletion`, then the expression
    `((a) as INotifyCompletion).OnCompleted(r)` is evaluated.

-   If a does implement `ICriticalNotifyCompletion`, then the expression
    `((a) as ICriticalNotifyCompletion).UnsafeOnCompleted(r)` is evaluated.

-   Evaluation is then suspended, and control is returned to the current caller of the async function.

<!-- -->

-   Either immediately after (if `b` was `true`), or upon later invocation of the resumption delegate (if `b` was `false`), the expression `(a).GetResult()` is evaluated. If it returns a value, that value is the result of the await-expression. Otherwise, the result is nothing.

An awaiter’s implementation of the interface methods `INotifyCompletion.OnCompleted` and `ICriticalNotifyCompletion.UnsafeOnCompleted` should cause the delegate r to be invoked at most once. Otherwise, the behavior of the enclosing async function is undefined.

## Arithmetic operators

### General

The `*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, and `–` operators are called the arithmetic operators.

[#Grammar_multiplicative_expression .anchor](#Grammar_multiplicative_expression .anchor)

[#_Ref70411174 .anchor](#_Ref70411174 .anchor)[#_Toc34995612 .anchor](#_Toc34995612 .anchor)[#_Toc511022860 .anchor](#_Toc511022860 .anchor)[#_Toc505664015 .anchor](#_Toc505664015 .anchor)[#_Toc505589869 .anchor](#_Toc505589869 .anchor)[#_Toc503164117 .anchor](#_Toc503164117 .anchor)[#_Toc501035443 .anchor](#_Toc501035443 .anchor)

If an operand of an arithmetic operator has the compile-time type dynamic, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type dynamic.

### Multiplication operator

For an operation of the form `x * y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined multiplication operators are listed below. The operators all compute the product of `x` and `y`.

-   Integer multiplication:

```csharp
int operator *(int x, int y);
uint operator *(uint x, uint y);
long operator *(long x, long y);
ulong operator *(ulong x, ulong y);
```

> In a checked context, if the product is outside the range of the result type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. In an unchecked context, overflows are not reported and any significant high-order bits outside the range of the result type are discarded.

-   Floating-point multiplication:

```csharp
float operator *(float x, float y);
double operator *(double x, double y);
```

> The product is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaN’s. In the table, x and y are positive finite values. z is the result of `x * y`, rounded to the nearest representable value. If the magnitude of the result is too large for the destination type, `z` is infinity. Because of rounding, `z` may be zero even though neither `x` nor `y` is zero.

  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
        +y    –y    +0    –0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  +x    +z    –z    +0    –0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  –x    –z    +z    –0    +0    –∞    +∞    NaN
  +0    +0    –0    +0    –0    NaN   NaN   NaN
  –0    –0    +0    –0    +0    NaN   NaN   NaN
  +∞    +∞    –∞    NaN   NaN   +∞    –∞    NaN
  –∞    –∞    +∞    NaN   NaN   –∞    +∞    NaN
  NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

(Except were otherwise noted, in the floating-point tables in §12.9.2–§12.9.6 the use of “+” means the value is positive; the use of “-” means the value is negative; and the lack of a sign means the value may be positive or negative or has no sign (NaN).)

-   Decimal multiplication:

```csharp
decimal operator *(decimal x, decimal y);
```

> If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the decimal format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. Because of rounding, the result may be zero even though neither operand is zero. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the sum of the scales of the two operands.
>
> Decimal multiplication is equivalent to using the multiplication operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined multiplication operators defined above are also predefined.

### Division operator

For an operation of the form `x` / `y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined division operators are listed below. The operators all compute the quotient of `x` and `y`.

-   Integer division:

```csharp
int operator /(int x, int y);
uint operator /(uint x, uint y);
long operator /(long x, long y);
ulong operator /(ulong x, ulong y);
```

> If the value of the right operand is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown.
>
> The division rounds the result towards zero. Thus the absolute value of the result is the largest possible integer that is less than or equal to the absolute value of the quotient of the two operands. The result is zero or positive when the two operands have the same sign and zero or negative when the two operands have opposite signs.
>
> If the left operand is the smallest representable int or long value and the right operand is –1, an overflow occurs. In a checked context, this causes a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) to be thrown. In an unchecked context, it is implementation-defined as to whether a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) is thrown or the overflow goes unreported with the resulting value being that of the left operand.

-   Floating-point division:

```csharp
float operator /(float x, float y);
double operator /(double x, double y);
```

> The quotient is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaN’s. In the table, `x` and `y` are positive finite values. `z` is the result of `x` / `y`, rounded to the nearest representable value.

  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
        +y    –y    +0    –0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  +x    +z    –z    +∞    –∞    +0    –0    NaN
  –x    –z    +z    –∞    +∞    –0    +0    NaN
  +0    +0    –0    NaN   NaN   +0    –0    NaN
  –0    –0    +0    NaN   NaN   –0    +0    NaN
  +∞    +∞    –∞    +∞    –∞    NaN   NaN   NaN
  –∞    –∞    +∞    –∞    +∞    NaN   NaN   NaN
  NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

-   Decimal division:

```csharp
decimal operator /(decimal x, decimal y);
```

> If the value of the right operand is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown. If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the decimal format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. Because of rounding, the result may be zero even though the first operand is not zero. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the closest scale to the preferred scale that will preserve a result equal to the exact result. The preferred scale is the scale of `x` less the scale of `y`.
>
> Decimal division is equivalent to using the division operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined division operators defined above are also predefined.

### Remainder operator

For an operation of the form `x` % `y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined remainder operators are listed below. The operators all compute the remainder of the division between `x` and `y`.

-   Integer remainder:

```csharp
int operator %(int x, int y);
uint operator %(uint x, uint y);
long operator %(long x, long y);
ulong operator %(ulong x, ulong y);
```

> The result of `x % y` is the value produced by x – (`x / y`) \* `y`. If `y` is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown.
>
> If the left operand is the smallest int or long value and the right operand is `–1`, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown if and only if `x / y` would throw an exception.

-   Floating-point remainder:

```csharp
float operator %(float x, float y);
double operator %(double x, double y);
```

> The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaN’s. In the table, `x` and `y` are positive finite values. `z` is the result of `x % y` and is computed as `x – n * y`, where n is the largest possible integer that is less than or equal to `x / y`. This method of computing the remainder is analogous to that used for integer operands, but differs from the IEC 60559 definition (in which `n` is the integer closest to `x / y`).

  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
        +y    –y    +0    –0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  +x    +z    +z    NaN   NaN   +x    +x    NaN
  –x    –z    –z    NaN   NaN   –x    –x    NaN
  +0    +0    +0    NaN   NaN   +0    +0    NaN
  –0    –0    –0    NaN   NaN   –0    –0    NaN
  +∞    NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN
  –∞    NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN
  NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

-   Decimal remainder:

decimal operator %(decimal `x`, decimal `y`);

If the value of the right operand is zero, a `System.DivideByZeroException` is thrown. It is implementation-defined when a `System.ArithmeticException` (or a subclass thereof) is thrown. A conforming implementation shall not throw an exception for `x % y` in any case where `x / y` does not throw an exception. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the larger of the scales of the two operands, and the sign of the result, if non-zero, is the same as that of `x`.

Decimal remainder is equivalent to using the remainder operator of type `System.Decimal`.

> [!NOTE] 
> These rules ensure that for all types, the result never has the opposite sign of the left operand.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined remainder operators defined above are also predefined.

### Addition operator

For an operation of the form `x + y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined addition operators are listed below. For numeric and enumeration types, the predefined addition operators compute the sum of the two operands. When one or both operands are of type string, the predefined addition operators concatenate the string representation of the operands.

-   Integer addition:

```csharp
int operator +(int x, int y);
uint operator +(uint x, uint y);
long operator +(long x, long y);
ulong operator +(ulong x, ulong y
```

> In a checked context, if the sum is outside the range of the result type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. In an unchecked context, overflows are not reported and any significant high-order bits outside the range of the result type are discarded.

-   Floating-point addition:

```csharp
float operator +(float x, float y);
double operator +(double x, double y);
```

> The sum is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaN’s. In the table, `x` and `y` are nonzero finite values, and `z` is the result of `x + y`,. If `x` and `y` have the same magnitude but opposite signs, `z` is positive zero. If `x + y` is too large to represent in the destination type, `z` is an infinity with the same sign as `x + y`.

  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
        y     +0    –0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  x     z     x     x     +∞    –∞    NaN
  +0    y     +0    +0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  –0    y     +0    –0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  +∞    +∞    +∞    +∞    +∞    NaN   NaN
  –∞    –∞    –∞    –∞    NaN   –∞    NaN
  NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

-   Decimal addition:

```csharp
decimal operator +(decimal x, decimal y);
```

> If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the decimal format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the larger of the scales of the two operands.
>
> Decimal addition is equivalent to using the addition operator of type `System.Decimal`.

-   Enumeration addition. Every enumeration type implicitly provides the following predefined operators, where `E` is the enum type, and `U` is the underlying type of `E`:

```csharp
E operator +(E x, U y);
E operator +(U x, E y);
```

> At run-time these operators are evaluated exactly as `(E)((U)x + (U)y`).

-   String concatenation:

```csharp
string operator +(string x, string y);
string operator +(string x, object y);
string operator +(object x, string y);
```

> These overloads of the binary + operator perform string concatenation. If an operand of string concatenation is null, an empty string is substituted. Otherwise, any non-string operand is converted to its string representation by invoking the virtual ToString method inherited from type object. If ToString returns null, an empty string is substituted. \[*Example*:

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
	static void Main() {
		string s = null;
		Console.WriteLine("s = >" + s + "<"); // displays s = ><
		int i = 1;
		Console.WriteLine("i = " + i); // displays i = 1
		float f = 1.2300E+15F;
		Console.WriteLine("f = " + f); // displays f = 1.23E+15
		decimal d = 2.900m;
		Console.WriteLine("d = " + d); // displays d = 2.900
	}
}
```

The output shown in the comments is the typical result on a US-English system. The precise output might depend on the regional settings of the execution environment. The string-concatenation operator itself behaves the same way in each case, but the ToString methods implicitly called during execution might be affected by regional settings. *end example*\]

> The result of the string concatenation operator is a string that consists of the characters of the left operand followed by the characters of the right operand. The string concatenation operator never returns a null value. A `System.OutOfMemoryException` may be thrown if there is not enough memory available to allocate the resulting string.

-   Delegate combination. Every delegate type implicitly provides the following predefined operator, where `D` is the delegate type:

```csharp
D operator +(D x, D y);
```

> [#_Ref485188932 .anchor](#_Ref485188932 .anchor)If the first operand is null, the result of the operation is the value of the second operand (even if that is also null). Otherwise, if the second operand is null, then the result of the operation is the value of the first operand. Otherwise, the result of the operation is a new delegate instance whose invocation list consists of the elements in the invocation list of the first operand, followed by the elements in the invocation list of the second operand. That is, the invocation list of the resulting delegate is the concatenation of the invocation lists of the two operands. 

> [!NOTE] 
> For examples of delegate combination, see §12.9.6 and §20.6. Since `System.Delegate` is not a delegate type, operator + is not defined for it.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined addition operators defined above are also predefined.

### Subtraction operator

For an operation of the form `x – y`, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined subtraction operators are listed below. The operators all subtract `y` from `x`.

-   Integer subtraction:

```csharp
int operator –(int x, int y);
uint operator –(uint x, uint y);
long operator –(long x, long y);
ulong operator –(ulong x, ulong y
```

> In a checked context, if the difference is outside the range of the result type, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. In an unchecked context, overflows are not reported and any significant high-order bits outside the range of the result type are discarded.

-   Floating-point subtraction:

```csharp
float operator –(float x, float y);
double operator –(double x, double y);
```

> The difference is computed according to the rules of IEC 60559 arithmetic. The following table lists the results of all possible combinations of nonzero finite values, zeros, infinities, and NaNs. In the table, `x` and `y` are nonzero finite values, and `z` is the result of `x – y`. If `x` and `y` are equal, `z` is positive zero. If `x – y` is too large to represent in the destination type, `z` is an infinity with the same sign as `x – y`.

  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
        y     +0    –0    +∞    –∞    NaN
  x     z     x     x     –∞    +∞    NaN
  +0    –y    +0    +0    –∞    +∞    NaN
  –0    –y    –0    +0    –∞    +∞    NaN
  +∞    +∞    +∞    +∞    NaN   +∞    NaN
  –∞    –∞    –∞    –∞    –∞    NaN   NaN
  NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN   NaN
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

(In the above table the `-y` entries denote the *negation* of `y`, not that the value is negative.)

-   Decimal subtraction:

```csharp
decimal operator –(decimal x, decimal y);
```

> If the magnitude of the resulting value is too large to represent in the decimal format, a `System.OverflowException` is thrown. The scale of the result, before any rounding, is the larger of the scales of the two operands.
>
> Decimal subtraction is equivalent to using the subtraction operator of type `System.Decimal`.

-   [#_Ref461349852 .anchor](#_Ref461349852 .anchor)[#_Toc445783009 .anchor](#_Toc445783009 .anchor)Enumeration subtraction. Every enumeration type implicitly provides the following predefined operator, where `E` is the enum type, and `U` is the underlying type of `E`:

```csharp
U operator –(E x, E y);
```

> This operator is evaluated exactly as `(U)((U)x – (U)y)`. In other words, the operator computes the difference between the ordinal values of x and y, and the type of the result is the underlying type of the enumeration.

```csharp
E operator –(E x, U y);
```

> This operator is evaluated exactly as `(E)((U)x – y)`. In other words, the operator subtracts a value from the underlying type of the enumeration, yielding a value of the enumeration.

-   Delegate removal. Every delegate type implicitly provides the following predefined operator, where `D` is the delegate type:

```csharp
D operator –(D x, D y);
```

> [#_Ref466793384 .anchor](#_Ref466793384 .anchor)[#_Ref461974749 .anchor](#_Ref461974749 .anchor)If the first operand is null, the result of the operation is null. Otherwise, if the second operand is null, then the result of the operation is the value of the first operand. Otherwise, both operands represent invocation lists (§20.2) having one or more entries, and the result is a new invocation list consisting of the first operand’s list with the second operand’s entries removed from it, provided the second operand’s list is a proper contiguous sublist of the first’s. (To determine sublist equality, corresponding entries are compared as for the delegate equality operator (§12.11.9).) Otherwise, the result is the value of the left operand. Neither of the operands’ lists is changed in the process. If the second operand’s list matches multiple sublists of contiguous entries in the first operand’s list, the right-most matching sublist of contiguous entries is removed. If removal results in an empty list, the result is null. \[*Example*:

```csharp
delegate void D(int x);
class C
{
	public static void M1(int i) { /* … */ }
	public static void M2(int i) { /* … */ }
}

class Test
{
	static void Main() {
		D cd1 = new D(C.M1);
		D cd2 = new D(C.M2);

		D cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
		cd3 -= cd1; // => M1 + M2 + M2

		cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
		cd3 -= cd1 + cd2; // => M2 + M1

		cd3 = cd1 + cd2 + cd2 + cd1; // M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
		cd3 -= cd1 + cd1; // => M1 + M2 + M2 + M1
	}
}
```

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined subtraction operators defined above are also predefined.

## Shift operators

The << and >> operators are used to perform bit-shifting operations.

[#Grammar_shift_expression .anchor](#Grammar_shift_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
shift-expression:
	additive-expression
	shift-expression << additive-expression
	shift-expression right-shift additive-expression
```

If an operand of a *shift-expression* has the compile-time type dynamic, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type dynamic.

For an operation of the form `x` << count or `x` >> count, binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

When declaring an overloaded shift operator, the type of the first operand shall always be the class or struct containing the operator declaration, and the type of the second operand shall always be int.

The predefined shift operators are listed below.

-   Shift left:

```csharp
int operator <<(int x, int count);
uint operator <<(uint x, int count);
long operator <<(long x, int count);
ulong operator <<(ulong x, int count);
```

> The << operator shifts `x` left by a number of bits computed as described below.
>
> The high-order bits outside the range of the result type of `x` are discarded, the remaining bits are shifted left, and the low-order empty bit positions are set to zero.

-   Shift right:

```csharp
int operator >>(int x, int count);
uint operator >>(uint x, int count);
long operator >>(long x, int count);
ulong operator >>(ulong x, int count);
```

> The >> operator shifts `x` right by a number of bits computed as described below.
>
> When `x` is of type int or long, the low-order bits of `x` are discarded, the remaining bits are shifted right, and the high-order empty bit positions are set to zero if `x` is non-negative and set to one if `x` is negative.
>
> When `x` is of type uint or ulong, the low-order bits of `x` are discarded, the remaining bits are shifted right, and the high-order empty bit positions are set to zero.

For the predefined operators, the number of bits to shift is computed as follows:

-   When the type of `x` is int or uint, the shift count is given by the low-order five bits of count. In other words, the shift count is computed from count & 0x1F.

-   When the type of `x` is long or ulong, the shift count is given by the low-order six bits of count. In other words, the shift count is computed from count & 0x3F.

If the resulting shift count is zero, the shift operators simply return the value of `x`.

Shift operations never cause overflows and produce the same results in checked and unchecked contexts.

When the left operand of the >> operator is of a signed integral type, the operator performs an *arithmetic* shift right wherein the value of the most significant bit (the sign bit) of the operand is propagated to the high-order empty bit positions. When the left operand of the >> operator is of an unsigned integral type, the operator performs a *logical* shift right wherein high-order empty bit positions are always set to zero. To perform the opposite operation of that inferred from the operand type, explicit casts can be used. \[*Example*: If `x` is a variable of type `int`, the operation unchecked`((int)((uint)x >> y))` performs a logical shift right of `x`. *end example*\]

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined shift operators defined above are also predefined.

## Relational and type-testing operators

### General

The `==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, is,` and as operators are called the relational and type-testing operators.

[#Grammar_relational_expression .anchor](#Grammar_relational_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
relational-expression:
	shift-expression
	relational-expression < shift-expression
	relational-expression > shift-expression
	relational-expression <= shift-expression
	relational-expression >= shift-expression
	relational-expression is type
	relational-expression as type
```

[#Grammar_equality_expression .anchor](#Grammar_equality_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
equality-expression:
	relational-expression
	equality-expression == relational-expression
	equality-expression != relational-expression
```

The is operator is described in §12.11.11 and the as operator is described in §12.11.12.

The `==, !=, <, >, <= and >=` operators are ***comparison operators***.

If an operand of a comparison operator has the compile-time type dynamic, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case the compile-time type of the expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type dynamic.

For an operation of the form `x` *op* `y`, where *op* is a comparison operator, overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator. If both operands of an *equality-expression* are the null literal, then overload resolution is not performed and the expression evaluates to a constant value of true or false according to whether the operator is `==` or `!=`.

The predefined comparison operators are described in the following subclauses. All predefined comparison operators return a result of type bool, as described in the following table.

  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  **Operation**   **Result**
  x == y          true if x is equal to y, false otherwise
  x != y          true if x is not equal to y, false otherwise
  x < y        true if x is less than y, false otherwise
  x > y        true if x is greater than y, false otherwise
  x <= y       true if x is less than or equal to y, false otherwise
  x >= y       true if x is greater than or equal to y, false otherwise
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

[#_Toc34995619 .anchor](#_Toc34995619 .anchor)[#_Toc511022867 .anchor](#_Toc511022867 .anchor)[#_Toc505664022 .anchor](#_Toc505664022 .anchor)[#_Toc505589876 .anchor](#_Toc505589876 .anchor)[#_Toc503164124 .anchor](#_Toc503164124 .anchor)[#_Toc501035450 .anchor](#_Toc501035450 .anchor)

### Integer comparison operators

The predefined integer comparison operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(int x, int y);
bool operator ==(uint x, uint y);
bool operator ==(long x, long y);
bool operator ==(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator !=(int x, int y);
bool operator !=(uint x, uint y);
bool operator !=(long x, long y);
bool operator !=(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator <(int x, int y);
bool operator <(uint x, uint y);
bool operator <(long x, long y);
bool operator <(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator >(int x, int y);
bool operator >(uint x, uint y);
bool operator >(long x, long y);
bool operator >(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator <=(int x, int y);
bool operator <=(uint x, uint y);
bool operator <=(long x, long y);
bool operator <=(ulong x, ulong y);

bool operator >=(int x, int y);
bool operator >=(uint x, uint y);
bool operator >=(long x, long y);
bool operator >=(ulong x, ulong y);
```

Each of these operators compares the numeric values of the two integer operands and returns a bool value that indicates whether the particular relation is true or false.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined integer comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Floating-point comparison operators

The predefined floating-point comparison operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(float x, float y);
bool operator ==(double x, double y);

bool operator !=(float x, float y);
bool operator !=(double x, double y);

bool operator <(float x, float y);
bool operator <(double x, double y);

bool operator >(float x, float y);
bool operator >(double x, double y);

bool operator <=(float x, float y);
bool operator <=(double x, double y);

bool operator >=(float x, float y);
bool operator >=(double x, double y);
```

The operators compare the operands according to the rules of the IEC 60559 standard:

If either operand is NaN, the result is false for all operators except `!=`, for which the result is true. For any two operands, `x != y` always produces the same result as `!(x == y)`. However, when one or both operands are NaN, the `<, >, <=`, and `>=` operators do *not* produce the same results as the logical negation of the opposite operator. \[*Example*: If either of `x` and `y` is NaN, then `x` < `y` is false, but `!(x >= y)` is true. *end example*\]

-   When neither operand is NaN, the operators compare the values of the two floating-point operands with respect to the ordering

```csharp
–∞ < –max < … < –min < –0.0 == +0.0 < +min < … < +max < +∞
```

> where min and max are the smallest and largest positive finite values that can be represented in the given floating-point format. Notable effects of this ordering are:

-   Negative and positive zeros are considered equal.

-   A negative infinity is considered less than all other values, but equal to another negative infinity.

-   A positive infinity is considered greater than all other values, but equal to another positive infinity.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined floating-point comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Decimal comparison operators

The predefined decimal comparison operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator !=(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator <(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator >(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator <=(decimal x, decimal y);
bool operator >=(decimal x, decimal y);
```

Each of these operators compares the numeric values of the two decimal operands and returns a bool value that indicates whether the particular relation is true or false. Each decimal comparison is equivalent to using the corresponding relational or equality operator of type `System.Decimal`.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined decimal comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Boolean equality operators

The predefined Boolean equality operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(bool x, bool y);
bool operator !=(bool x, bool y);
```

The result of == is true if both `x` and `y` are true or if both `x` and `y` are false. Otherwise, the result is false.

The result of != is false if both `x` and `y` are true or if both `x` and `y` are false. Otherwise, the result is true. When the operands are of type bool, the `!=` operator produces the same result as the `^` operator.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined Boolean equality operators defined above are also predefined.

### Enumeration comparison operators

Every enumeration type implicitly provides the following predefined comparison operators

```csharp
bool operator ==(E x, E y);
bool operator !=(E x, E y);

bool operator <(E x, E y);
bool operator >(E x, E y);
bool operator <=(E x, E y);
bool operator >=(E x, E y);
```

The result of evaluating `x` *op* `y`, where x and y are expressions of an enumeration type `E` with an underlying type `U`, and *op* is one of the comparison operators, is exactly the same as evaluating `((U)x)` *op *`((U)y)`. In other words, the enumeration type comparison operators simply compare the underlying integral values of the two operands.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined enumeration comparison operators defined above are also predefined.

### Reference type equality operators

Every class type `C` implicitly provides the following predefined reference type equality operators:

bool operator ==`(C x, C y)`;

bool operator !=`(C x, C y)`;

unless predefined equality operators otherwise exist for `C` (for example, when `C` is string or `System.Delegate`).

The operators return the result of comparing the two references for equality or non-equality. operator `==` returns true if and only if `x` and `y` refer to the same instance or are both null, while operator `!=` returns true if and only if operator == with the same operands would return false.

In addition to normal applicability rules (§12.6.4.2), the predefined reference type equality operators require one of the following in order to be applicable:

-   Both operands are a value of a type known to be a *reference-type* or the literal null. Furthermore, an explicit identity or reference conversion (§11.3.5) exists from either operand to the type of the other operand.

-   One operand is the literal null, and the other operand is a value of type `T` where `T` is a *type-parameter* that is not known to be a value type, and does not have the value type constraint.

<!-- -->

-   If at runtime `T` is a non-nullable value type, the result of `==` is false and the result of `!=` is true.

-   If at runtime `T` is a nullable value type, the result is computed from the HasValue property of the operand, as described in (§12.11.10).

-   If at runtime `T` is a reference type, the result is true if the operand is null, and false otherwise.

Unless one of these conditions is true, a binding-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> Notable implications of these rules are:

-   It is a binding-time error to use the predefined reference type equality operators to compare two references that are known to be different at binding-time. For example, if the binding-time types of the operands are two class types, and if neither derives from the other, then it would be impossible for the two operands to reference the same object. Thus, the operation is considered a binding-time error.

-   The predefined reference type equality operators do not permit value type operands to be compared (except when type parameters are compared to null, which is handled specially).

-   Operands of predefined reference type equality operators are never boxed. It would be meaningless to perform such boxing operations, since references to the newly allocated boxed instances would necessarily differ from all other references.

For an operation of the form `x == y` or `x != y`, if any applicable user-defined operator `==` or operator `!=` exists, the operator overload resolution rules (§12.4.5) will select that operator instead of the predefined reference type equality operator. It is always possible to select the predefined reference type equality operator by explicitly casting one or both of the operands to type object. *end note*\]

\[*Example*: The following example checks whether an argument of an unconstrained type parameter type is null.

```csharp
class C<T>
{
	void F(T x) {
		if (x == null) throw new ArgumentNullException();
		…
	}
}
```

The `x` `==` null construct is permitted even though `T` could represent a non-nullable value type, and the result is simply defined to be false when `T` is a non-nullable value type. *end example*\]

For an operation of the form `x == y` or `x != y`, if any applicable operator `==` or operator `!=` exists, the operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) rules will select that operator instead of the predefined reference type equality operator. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is always possible to select the predefined reference type equality operator by explicitly casting both of the operands to type object.

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

class Test
{
	static void Main() {
		string s = "Test";
		string t = string.Copy(s);
		Console.WriteLine(s == t);
		Console.WriteLine((object)s == t);
		Console.WriteLine(s == (object)t);
		Console.WriteLine((object)s == (object)t);
	}
}
```

produces the output

```csharp
True
False
False
False
```

The `s` and `t` variables refer to two distinct string instances containing the same characters. The first comparison outputs True because the predefined string equality operator (§12.11.8) is selected when both operands are of type string. The remaining comparisons all output False because the overload of operator`==` in the string type is not applicable when either operand has a binding-time type of object.

Note that the above technique is not meaningful for value types. The example

```csharp
class Test
{
	static void Main() {
		int i = 123;
		int j = 123;
		System.Console.WriteLine((object)i == (object)j);
	}
}
```

outputs False because the casts create references to two separate instances of boxed int values. *end example*\]

### String equality operators

The predefined string equality operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(string x, string y);
bool operator !=(string x, string y);
```

Two string values are considered equal when one of the following is true:

-   Both values are null.

-   Both values are non-null references to string instances that have identical lengths and identical characters in each character position.

[#_Ref462720250 .anchor](#_Ref462720250 .anchor)The string equality operators compare string values rather than string references. When two separate string instances contain the exact same sequence of characters, the values of the strings are equal, but the references are different. 

> [!NOTE] 
> As described in §12.11.7, the reference type equality operators can be used to compare string references instead of string values.

### Delegate equality operators

The predefined delegate equality operators are:

```csharp
bool operator ==(System.Delegate x, System.Delegate y);

bool operator !=(System.Delegate x, System.Delegate y);
```

Two delegate instances are considered equal as follows:

-   If either of the delegate instances is null, they are equal if and only if both are null.

-   If the delegates have different run-time type, they are never equal.

-   If both of the delegate instances have an invocation list (§20.2), those instances are equal if and only if their invocation lists are the same length, and each entry in one’s invocation list is equal (as defined below) to the corresponding entry, in order, in the other’s invocation list.

The following rules govern the equality of invocation list entries:

-   If two invocation list entries both refer to the same static method then the entries are equal.

-   If two invocation list entries both refer to the same non-static method on the same target object (as defined by the reference equality operators) then the entries are equal.

-   Invocation list entries produced from evaluation of semantically identical anonymous functions (§12.16) with the same (possibly empty) set of captured outer variable instances are permitted (but not required) to be equal.

[#_Ref473185097 .anchor](#_Ref473185097 .anchor)If operator overload resolution resolves to either delegate equality operator, and the binding-time types of both operands are delegate types as described in §20 rather than `System.Delegate`, and there is no identity conversion between the binding-type operand types, a binding-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule prevents comparisons which can never consider non-null values as equal due to being references to instances of different types of delegates.

### Equality operators between nullable value types and the null literal

The `==` and `!=` operators permit one operand to be `a` value of `a` nullable value type and the other to be the null literal, even if no predefined or user-defined operator (in unlifted or lifted form) exists for the operation.

For an operation of one of the forms

```csharp
x == null null == x x != null null != x
```

where `x` is an expression of a nullable value type, if operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) fails to find an applicable operator, the result is instead computed from the HasValue property of `x`. Specifically, the first two forms are translated into `!x.HasValue`, and the last two forms are translated into `x.HasValue`.

### The is operator

The is operator is used to check if the run-time type of an object is compatible with a given type. The check is performed at runtime. The result of the operation `E` is `T`, where E is an expression and `T` is a type other than dynamic, is a Boolean value indicating whether `E` is non-null and can successfully be converted to type `T` by a reference conversion, a boxing conversion, an unboxing conversion, a wrapping conversion, or an unwrapping conversion.

The operation is evaluated as follows:

1.  If `E` is an anonymous function, a compile-time error occurs

If `E` is a method group or the null literal, of if the value of `E` is null, the result is false.

Otherwise:

Let `R` be the runtime type of `E`.

Let `D` be derived from `R` as follows:

If `R` is a nullable value type, `D` is the underlying type of `R`.

Otherwise, `D` is `R`.

The result depends on `D` and `T` as follows:

If `T` is a reference type, the result is true if:

-   `D` and `T` are the same type,

-   `D` is a reference type and an implicit reference conversion from `D` to `T` exists, or

-   Either: `D` is a value type and a boxing conversion from `D` to `T` exists.\
    Or: `D` is a value type and `T` is an interface type implemented by `D`.

If `T` is a nullable value type, the result is true if `D` is the underlying type of `T`.

If `T` is a non-nullable value type, the result is true if `D` and `T` are the same type.

Otherwise, the result is false.

User defined conversions are not considered by the is operator.

> [!NOTE]
> As the is operator is evaluated at runtime, all type arguments have been substituted and there are no open types (§9.4.3) to consider.

> [!NOTE]
> The is operator can be understood in terms of compile-time types and conversions as follows, where `C` is the compile-time type of `E`:

-   If the compile-time type of `e` is the same as `T`, or if an implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7), boxing conversion (§11.2.8), wrapping conversion (§11.6), or an explicit unwrapping conversion (§11.6) exists from the compile-time type of `E` to `T`:

<!-- -->

-   If `C` is of a non-nullable value type, the result of the operation is true.

-   Otherwise, the result of the operation is equivalent to evaluating `E` `!=` null.

<!-- -->

-   Otherwise, if an explicit reference conversion (§11.3.5) or unboxing conversion (§11.3.6) exists from `C` to `T`, or if `C` or `T` is an open type (§9.4.3), then runtime checks as above must be peformed.

-   Otherwise, no reference, boxing, wrapping, or unwrapping conversion of `E` to type `T` is possible, and the result of the operation is false.

A compiler may implement optimisations based on the compile-time type. *end note*\]

### The as operator

The as operator is used to explicitly convert a value to a given reference type or nullable value type. Unlike a cast expression (§12.8.7), the as operator never throws an exception. Instead, if the indicated conversion is not possible, the resulting value is null.

In an operation of the form `E` as `T`, `E` shall be an expression and `T` shall be a reference type, a type parameter known to be a reference type, or a nullable value type. Furthermore, at least one of the following shall be true, or otherwise a compile-time error occurs:

-   An identity (§11.2.2), implicit nullable (§11.2.5), implicit reference (§11.2.7), boxing (§11.2.8), explicit nullable (§11.3.4), explicit reference (§11.3.5), or wrapping (§9.3.11) conversion exists from `E` to `T`.

-   The type of `E` or `T` is an open type.

-   `E` is the null literal.

If the compile-time type of `E` is not dynamic, the operation `E` as `T` produces the same result as

`E` is `T` ? `(T)(E)` : `(T)`null

except that `E` is only evaluated once. The compiler can be expected to optimize `E` as `T` to perform at most one runtime type check as opposed to the two runtime type checks implied by the expansion above.

If the compile-time type of `E` is dynamic, unlike the cast operator the as operator is not dynamically bound (§12.3.3). Therefore the expansion in this case is:

`E` is `T` ? `(T)`(object)`(E)` : `(T)`null

Note that some conversions, such as user defined conversions, are not possible with the as operator and should instead be performed using cast expressions.

\[*Example*: In the example

```csharp
class X
{

	public string F(object o) {
		return o as string; // OK, string is a reference type
	}

	public T G<T>(object o) where T: Attribute {
		return o as T; // Ok, T has a class constraint
	}

	public U H<U>(object o) {
		return o as U; // Error, U is unconstrained
	}
}
```

the type parameter `T` of `G` is known to be a reference type, because it has the class constraint. The type parameter `U` of `H` is not however; hence the use of the as operator in `H` is disallowed. *end example*\]

##  Logical operators

### General

The `&,` `^`, and `|` operators are called the logical operators.

[#Grammar_and_expression .anchor](#Grammar_and_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
and-expression:
	equality-expression
	and-expression & equality-expression
```

[#Grammar_exclusive_or_expression .anchor](#Grammar_exclusive_or_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
exclusive-or-expression:
	and-expression
	exclusive-or-expression ^ and-expression
```

[#Grammar_inclusive_or_expression .anchor](#Grammar_inclusive_or_expression .anchor)inclusive-or-expression:

```ANTLR
exclusive-or-expression
inclusive-or-expression | exclusive-or-expression
```

If an operand of a logical operator has the compile-time type dynamic, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case the compile-time type of the expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type dynamic.

For an operation of the form `x` *op* `y`, where *op* is one of the logical operators, overload resolution (§12.4.5) is applied to select a specific operator implementation. The operands are converted to the parameter types of the selected operator, and the type of the result is the return type of the operator.

The predefined logical operators are described in the following subclauses.

### Integer logical operators

The predefined integer logical operators are:

```csharp
int operator &(int x, int y);
uint operator &(uint x, uint y);
long operator &(long x, long y);
ulong operator &(ulong x, ulong y);

int operator |(int x, int y);
uint operator |(uint x, uint y);
long operator |(long x, long y);
ulong operator |(ulong x, ulong y);

int operator \^(int x, int y);
uint operator \^(uint x, uint y);
long operator \^(long x, long y);
ulong operator \^(ulong x, ulong y);
```

The & operator computes the bitwise logical AND of the two operands, the | operator computes the bitwise logical OR of the two operands, and the `\^` operator computes the bitwise logical exclusive OR of the two operands. No overflows are possible from these operations.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined integer logical operators defined above are also predefined.

### Enumeration logical operators

Every enumeration type `E` implicitly provides the following predefined logical operators:

```csharp
E operator &(E x, E y);
E operator |(E x, E y);
E operator \^(E x, E y);
```

The result of evaluating `x *op *y`, where `x` and `y` are expressions of an enumeration type `E` with an underlying type `U`, and `*op*` is one of the logical operators, is exactly the same as evaluating `(E)((U)x` *op* `(U)y)`. In other words, the enumeration type logical operators simply perform the logical operation on the underlying type of the two operands.

Lifted (§12.4.8) forms of the unlifted predefined enumeration logical operators defined above are also predefined.

### Boolean logical operators

The predefined Boolean logical operators are:

```csharp
bool operator &(bool x, bool y);
bool operator |(bool x, bool y);
bool operator ^(bool x, bool y);
```

The result of `x` & `y` is true if both `x` and `y` are true. Otherwise, the result is false.

The result of `x` | `y` is true if either `x` or `y` is true. Otherwise, the result is false.

The result of `x ^ y` is true if `x` is true and `y` is false, or `x` is false and `y` is true. Otherwise, the result is false. When the operands are of type bool, the `^` operator computes the same result as the != operator.

### Nullable Boolean & and | operators

The nullable Boolean type bool? can represent three values, true, false, and null.

As with the other binary operators, lifted forms of the logical operators & and | (§12.12.4) are also pre-defined:

```csharp
bool? operator &(bool? x, bool? y);
bool? operator |(bool? x, bool? y);
```

The semantics of the lifted & and | operators are defined by the following table:

  x       y       x & y   x | y
  ------- ------- ------- -------
  true    true    true    true
  true    false   false   true
  true    null    null    true
  false   true    false   true
  false   false   false   false
  false   null    false   null
  null    true    null    true
  null    false   false   null
  null    null    null    null

> [!NOTE]
> The bool? type is conceptually similar to the three-valued type used for Boolean expressions in SQL. The table above follows the same semantics as SQL, whereas applying the rules of §12.4.8 to the & and | operators would not. The rules of §12.4.8 already provide SQL-like semantics for the lifted ^ operator.

## Conditional logical operators

### General

The `&&` and `||` operators are called the conditional logical operators. They are also called the “short-circuiting” logical operators.

[#Grammar_conditional_and_expression .anchor](#Grammar_conditional_and_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
conditional-and-expression:
	inclusive-or-expression
	conditional-and-expression && inclusive-or-expression
```

[#Grammar_conditional_or_expression .anchor](#Grammar_conditional_or_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
conditional-or-expression:
	conditional-and-expression
	conditional-or-expression || conditional-and-expression
```

The `&&` and `||` operators are conditional versions of the `&` and `|` operators:

-   The operation `x && y` corresponds to the operation `x & y`, except that `y` is evaluated only if `x` is not false.

-   The operation `x || y` corresponds to the operation `x | y`, except that `y` is evaluated only if `x` is not true.

> [!NOTE]
> The reason that short circuiting uses the 'not true' and 'not false' conditions is to enable user-defined conditional operators to define when short circuiting applies. User-defined types could be in a state where operator true returns false and operator false returns false. In those cases, neither `&&` nor `||` would short circuit.

If an operand of a conditional logical operator has the compile-time type dynamic, then the expression is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case the compile-time type of the expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time using the run-time type of those operands that have the compile-time type dynamic.

An operation of the form `x` && `y` or `x` || `y` is processed by applying overload resolution (§12.4.5) as if the operation was written `x` & `y` or `x` | `y`. Then,

-   If overload resolution fails to find a single best operator, or if overload resolution selects one of the predefined integer logical operators or nullable Boolean logical operators (§12.12.5), a binding-time error occurs.

-   Otherwise, if the selected operator is one of the predefined Boolean logical operators (§12.12.4), the operation is processed as described in §12.13.2.

-   Otherwise, the selected operator is a user-defined operator, and the operation is processed as described in §12.13.3.

[#_Ref463404645 .anchor](#_Ref463404645 .anchor)It is not possible to directly overload the conditional logical operators. However, because the conditional logical operators are evaluated in terms of the regular logical operators, overloads of the regular logical operators are, with certain restrictions, also considered overloads of the conditional logical operators. This is described further in §12.13.3.

### Boolean conditional logical operators

When the operands of `&&` or `||` are of type bool, or when the operands are of types that do not define an applicable operator & or operator `|`, but do define implicit conversions to bool, the operation is processed as follows:

-   The operation `x` `&&` `y` is evaluated as `x` ? `y` : false. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and converted to type bool. Then, if `x` is true, `y` is evaluated and converted to type bool, and this becomes the result of the operation. Otherwise, the result of the operation is false.

-   The operation `x` || y is evaluated as `x` ? true : `y`. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and converted to type bool. Then, if `x` is true, the result of the operation is true. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated and converted to type bool, and this becomes the result of the operation.

### User-defined conditional logical operators

When the operands of `&&` or `||` are of types that declare an applicable user-defined operator `&` or operator `|`, both of the following shall be true, where `T` is the type in which the selected operator is declared:

-   The return type and the type of each parameter of the selected operator shall be `T`. In other words, the operator shall compute the logical AND or the logical OR of two operands of type `T`, and shall return a result of type `T`.

-   `T` shall contain declarations of operator true and operator false.

A binding-time error occurs if either of these requirements is not satisfied. Otherwise, the `&&` or `||` operation is evaluated by combining the user-defined operator true or operator false with the selected user-defined operator:

-   The operation `x` `&&` `y` is evaluated as `T.false(x)` ? `x` : `T.&(x, y)`, where `T.false(x)` is an invocation of the operator false declared in `T`, and `T.&(x, y)` is an invocation of the selected operator `&`. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and operator false is invoked on the result to determine if `x` is definitely false. Then, if `x` is definitely false, the result of the operation is the value previously computed for `x`. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated, and the selected operator `&` is invoked on the value previously computed for `x` and the value computed for `y` to produce the result of the operation.

-   The operation `x` `||` `y` is evaluated as `T.true(x)` ? `x` : `T.|(x, y)`, where `T.true(x)` is an invocation of the operator true declared in `T`, and `T.|(x, y)` is an invocation of the selected operator `|`. In other words, `x` is first evaluated and operator true is invoked on the result to determine if `x` is definitely true. Then, if `x` is definitely true, the result of the operation is the value previously computed for `x`. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated, and the selected operator `|` is invoked on the value previously computed for `x` and the value computed for `y` to produce the result of the operation.

In either of these operations, the expression given by `x` is only evaluated once, and the expression given by `y` is either not evaluated or evaluated exactly once.

## The null coalescing operator

The `??` operator is called the null coalescing operator.

[#Grammar_null_coalescing_expression .anchor](#Grammar_null_coalescing_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
null-coalescing-expression:
	conditional-or-expression
	conditional-or-expression ?? null-coalescing-expression
```

A null coalescing expression of the form a `??` b requires a to be the null literal (§7.4.5.7), or to be of a nullable value type or reference type. If a is non-null, the result of a `?? b` is `a;` otherwise, the result is `b`. The operation evaluates `b` only if a is null.

The null coalescing operator is right-associative, meaning that operations are grouped from right to left. \[*Example*: An expression of the form a `?? b ?? c` is evaluated as a `?? (b ?? c)`. In general terms, an expression of the form `E1 ?? E2 ?? … ?? EN` returns the first of the operands that is non-null, or null if all operands are null. *end example*\]

The type of the expression `a ?? b` depends on which implicit conversions are available on the operands. In order of preference, the type of `a ?? b` is `A0`, `A`, or `B`, where `A` is the type of a (provided that a has a type), `B` is the type of `b`(provided that `b` has a type), and `A0` is the underlying type of `A` if `A` is a nullable value type, or `A` otherwise. Specifically, `a ?? b` is processed as follows:

-   If `A` exists and is not a nullable value type or a reference type, a compile-time error occurs.

-   If `b` is a dynamic expression, the result type is dynamic. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If a is not null, `a` is converted to dynamic, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated, and this becomes the result.

-   Otherwise, if `A` exists and is a nullable value type and an implicit conversion exists from `b` to `A0`, the result type is `A0`. At run-time, a is first evaluated. If a is not null, a is unwrapped to type `A0`, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and converted to type `A0`, and this becomes the result.

-   Otherwise, if `A` exists and an implicit conversion exists from `b` to `A`, the result type is `A`. At run-time, a is first evaluated. If a is not null, a becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and converted to type `A`, and this becomes the result.

-   Otherwise, if `A` exists and is `a` nullable value type, `b` has `a` type `B` and an implicit conversion exists from `A0` to `B`, the result type is `B`. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If `a` is not null, `a` is unwrapped to type `A0` and converted to type `B`, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and becomes the result.

-   Otherwise, if `b` has `a` type `B` and an implicit conversion exists from `a` to `B`, the result type is `B`. At run-time, `a` is first evaluated. If `a` is not null, `a` is converted to type `B`, and this becomes the result. Otherwise, `b` is evaluated and becomes the result.

Otherwise, `a` and `b` are incompatible, and `a` compile-time error occurs.

## Conditional operator

The `?:` operator is called the conditional operator. It is at times also called the ternary operator.

[#Grammar_conditional_expression .anchor](#Grammar_conditional_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
conditional-expression:
	null-coalescing-expression
	null-coalescing-expression ? expression : expression
```

A conditional expression of the form `b ? x : y` first evaluates the condition `b`. Then, if `b` is true, `x` is evaluated and becomes the result of the operation. Otherwise, `y` is evaluated and becomes the result of the operation. A conditional expression never evaluates both `x` and `y`.

The conditional operator is right-associative, meaning that operations are grouped from right to left. \[*Example*: An expression of the form `a ? b : c ? d : e` is evaluated as `a ? b : (c ? d : e)`. *end example*\]

The first operand of the `?:` operator shall be an expression that can be implicitly converted to bool, or an expression of a type that implements operator true. If neither of these requirements is satisfied, a compile-time error occurs.

The second and third operands, `x` and `y`, of the `?:` operator control the type of the conditional expression.

-   If `x` has type `X` and `y` has type `Y` then,

<!-- -->

-   If `X` and `Y` are the same type, then this is the type of the conditional expression.

-   Otherwise, if an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from `X` to `Y`, but not from `Y` to `X`, then `Y` is the type of the conditional expression.

-   Otherwise, if an implicit enumeration conversion (§11.2.4) exists from `X` to `Y`, then `Y` is the type of the conditional expression.

-   Otherwise, if an implicit enumeration conversion (§11.2.4) exists from `Y` to `X`, then `X` is the type of the conditional expression.

-   Otherwise, if an implicit conversion (§11.2) exists from `Y` to `X`, but not from `X` to `Y`, then `X` is the type of the conditional expression.

-   Otherwise, no expression type can be determined, and a compile-time error occurs.[#_Ref448204698 .anchor](#_Ref448204698 .anchor)[#_Toc445783014 .anchor](#_Toc445783014 .anchor)

<!-- -->

-   If only one of `x` and `y` has a type, and both `x` and `y` are implicitly convertible to that type, then that is the type of the conditional expression.

-   Otherwise, no expression type can be determined, and a compile-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a conditional expression of the form `b ? x : y` consists of the following steps:

-   First, `b` is evaluated, and the bool value of `b` is determined:

<!-- -->

-   If an implicit conversion from the type of `b` to bool exists, then this implicit conversion is performed to produce a bool value.

-   Otherwise, the operator true defined by the type of `b` is invoked to produce a bool value.

<!-- -->

-   If the bool value produced by the step above is `true`, then `x` is evaluated and converted to the type of the conditional expression, and this becomes the result of the conditional expression.

-   Otherwise, `y` is evaluated and converted to the type of the conditional expression, and this becomes the result of the conditional expression.

## Anonymous function expressions

### General

An ***anonymous function*** is an expression that represents an “in-line” method definition. An anonymous function does not have a value or type in and of itself, but is convertible to a compatible delegate or expression-tree type. The evaluation of an anonymous-function conversion depends on the target type of the conversion: If it is a delegate type, the conversion evaluates to a delegate value referencing the method that the anonymous function defines. If it is an expression-tree type, the conversion evaluates to an expression tree that represents the structure of the method as an object structure.

> [!NOTE]
> For historical reasons, there are two syntactic flavors of anonymous functions, namely *lambda-expression*s and *anonymous-method-expression*s. For almost all purposes, *lambda-expression*s are more concise and expressive than *anonymous-method-expression*s, which remain in the language for backwards compatibility.

The `=>` operator has the same precedence as assignment `(=)` and is right-associative.

An anonymous function with the async modifier is an async function and follows the rules described in §15.15.

The parameters of an anonymous function in the form of a *lambda-expression* can be explicitly or implicitly typed. In an explicitly typed parameter list, the type of each parameter is explicitly stated. In an implicitly typed parameter list, the types of the parameters are inferred from the context in which the anonymous function occurs—specifically, when the anonymous function is converted to a compatible delegate type or expression tree type, that type provides the parameter types (§11.7).

In a *lambda-expression* with a single, implicitly typed parameter, the parentheses may be omitted from the parameter list. In other words, an anonymous function of the form

```csharp
( param ) => expr
```

can be abbreviated to

```csharp
param => expr
```

The parameter list of an anonymous function in the form of an *anonymous-method-expression* is optional. If given, the parameters shall be explicitly typed. If not, the anonymous function is convertible to a delegate with any parameter list not containing out parameters.

A *block* body of an anonymous function is always reachable (§13.2).

\[*Example*: Some examples of anonymous functions follow below:

```csharp
x => x + 1 // Implicitly typed, expression body

x => { return x + 1; } // Implicitly typed, statement body

(int x) => x + 1 // Explicitly typed, expression body

(int x) => { return x + 1; } // Explicitly typed, statement body

(x, y) => x * y // Multiple parameters

() => Console.WriteLine() // No parameters

async (t1,t2) => await t1 + await t2 // Async

delegate (int x) { return x + 1; } // Anonymous method expression

delegate { return 1 + 1; } // Parameter list omitted
```

*end example*\]

The behavior of *lambda-expression*s and *anonymous-method-expression*s is the same except for the following points:

-   *anonymous-method-expression*s permit the parameter list to be omitted entirely, yielding convertibility to delegate types of any list of value parameters.

-   *lambda-expression*s permit parameter types to be omitted and inferred whereas *anonymous-method-expression*s require parameter types to be explicitly stated.

-   The body of a *lambda-expression* can be an expression or a statement block whereas the body of an *anonymous-method-expression* shall be a statement block.

-   Only *lambda-expression*s have conversions to compatible expression tree types (§9.6).

### Anonymous function signatures

The *anonymous-function-signature* of an anonymous function defines the names and optionally the types of the formal parameters for the anonymous function. The scope of the parameters of the anonymous function is the *anonymous-function-body* (§8.7). Together with the parameter list (if given) the anonymous-method-body constitutes a declaration space (§8.3). It is thus a compile-time error for the name of a parameter of the anonymous function to match the name of a local variable, local constant or parameter whose scope includes the *anonymous-method-expression* or *lambda-expression*.

If an anonymous function has an *explicit-anonymous-function-signature*, then the set of compatible delegate types and expression tree types is restricted to those that have the same parameter types and modifiers in the same order (§11.7). In contrast to method group conversions (§11.8), contra-variance of anonymous function parameter types is not supported. If an anonymous function does not have an *anonymous-function-signature*, then the set of compatible delegate types and expression tree types is restricted to those that have no out parameters.

Note that an *anonymous-function-signature* cannot include attributes or a parameter array. Nevertheless, an *anonymous-function-signature* may be compatible with a delegate type whose parameter list contains a parameter array.

Note also that conversion to an expression tree type, even if compatible, may still fail at compile-time (§9.6).

### Anonymous function bodies

The body (*expression* or *block*) of an anonymous function is subject to the following rules:

-   If the anonymous function includes a signature, the parameters specified in the signature are available in the body. If the anonymous function has no signature it can be converted to a delegate type or expression type having parameters (§11.7), but the parameters cannot be accessed in the body.

-   Except for ref or out parameters specified in the signature (if any) of the nearest enclosing anonymous function, it is a compile-time error for the body to access a ref or out parameter.

-   When the type of this is a struct type, it is a compile-time error for the body to access this. This is true whether the access is explicit (as in `this.x`) or implicit (as in `x` where `x` is an instance member of the struct). This rule simply prohibits such access and does not affect whether member lookup results in a member of the struct.

-   The body has access to the outer variables (§12.16.6) of the anonymous function. Access of an outer variable will reference the instance of the variable that is active at the time the *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression* is evaluated (§12.16.7).

-   It is a compile-time error for the body to contain a goto statement, a break statement, or a continue statement whose target is outside the body or within the body of a contained anonymous function.

-   A return statement in the body returns control from an invocation of the nearest enclosing anonymous function, not from the enclosing function member.

It is explicitly unspecified whether there is any way to execute the block of an anonymous function other than through evaluation and invocation of the *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression*. In particular, the compiler may choose to implement an anonymous function by synthesizing one or more named methods or types. The names of any such synthesized elements shall be of a form reserved for compiler use (§7.4.3).

### Overload resolution

Anonymous functions in an argument list participate in type inference and overload resolution. Refer to §12.6.3 and §12.6.4 for the exact rules.

\[*Example*: The following example illustrates the effect of anonymous functions on overload resolution.

```csharp
class ItemList<T>: List<T>
{
	public int Sum(Func<T,int> selector) {
		int sum = 0;
		foreach (T item in this) sum += selector(item);
		return sum;
	}

	public double Sum(Func<T,double> selector) {
		double sum = 0;
		foreach (T item in this) sum += selector(item);
		return sum;
	}
}
```

The `ItemList<T>` class has two Sum methods. Each takes a selector argument, which extracts the value to sum over from a list item. The extracted value can be either an int or a double and the resulting sum is likewise either an int or a double.

The Sum methods could for example be used to compute sums from a list of detail lines in an order.

```csharp
class Detail
{
	public int UnitCount;
	public double UnitPrice;
	…
}

void ComputeSums() {
	ItemList<Detail> orderDetails = GetOrderDetails(…);
	int totalUnits = orderDetails.Sum(d => d.UnitCount);
	double orderTotal = orderDetails.Sum(d => d.UnitPrice * d.UnitCount);
	…
}
```
In the first invocation of `orderDetails.Sum`, both Sum methods are applicable because the anonymous function `d => d.UnitCount` is compatible with both `Func<Detail,int>` and `Func<Detail,double>`. However, overload resolution picks the first Sum method because the conversion to `Func<Detail,int>` is better than the conversion to Func<Detail,double>.

In the second invocation of `orderDetails.Sum`, only the second Sum method is applicable because the anonymous function `d => d.UnitPrice * d.UnitCount` produces a value of type double. Thus, overload resolution picks the second Sum method for that invocation. *end example*\]

### Anonymous functions and dynamic binding

An anonymous function cannot be a receiver, argument, or operand of a dynamically bound operation.

### Outer variables

#### General

Any local variable, value parameter, or parameter array whose scope includes the *lambda-expression* or *anonymous-method-expression* is called an ***outer variable*** of the anonymous function. In an instance function member of a class, the this value is considered a value parameter and is an outer variable of any anonymous function contained within the function member.

#### Captured outer variables

When an outer variable is referenced by an anonymous function, the outer variable is said to have been ***captured*** by the anonymous function. Ordinarily, the lifetime of a local variable is limited to execution of the block or statement with which it is associated (§10.2.8). However, the lifetime of a captured outer variable is extended at least until the delegate or expression tree created from the anonymous function becomes eligible for garbage collection.

\[*Example*: In the example

```csharp
using System;

delegate int D();

class Test
{
	static D F() {
		int x = 0;
		D result = () => ++x;
		return result;
	}

	static void Main() {
		D d = F();
		Console.WriteLine(d());
		Console.WriteLine(d());
		Console.WriteLine(d());
	}
}
```
the local variable `x` is captured by the anonymous function, and the lifetime of `x` is extended at least until the delegate returned from `F` becomes eligible for garbage collection. Since each invocation of the anonymous function operates on the same instance of `x`, the output of the example is:

```csharp
1
2
3
```
*end example*\]

When a local variable or a value parameter is captured by an anonymous function, the local variable or parameter is no longer considered to be a fixed variable (§23.4), but is instead considered to be a moveable variable. However, captured outer variables cannot be used in a fixed statement (§23.7), so the address of a captured outer variable cannot be taken.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike an uncaptured variable, a captured local variable can be simultaneously exposed to multiple threads of execution.

#### Instantiation of local variables

A local variable is considered to be ***instantiated*** when execution enters the scope of the variable. \[*Example*: For example, when the following method is invoked, the local variable `x` is instantiated and initialized three times—once for each iteration of the loop.

```csharp
static void F() {
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		int x = i \* 2 + 1;
		…
	}
}
```

However, moving the declaration of `x` outside the loop results in a single instantiation of `x`:

```csharp
static void F() {
	int x;
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		x = i \* 2 + 1;
		…
	}
}
```

*end exa*mple\]

When not captured, there is no way to observe exactly how often a local variable is instantiated—because the lifetimes of the instantiations are disjoint, it is possible for each instantation to simply use the same storage location. However, when an anonymous function captures a local variable, the effects of instantiation become apparent.

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
using System;

delegate void D();

class Test
{
	static D[] F() {
		D[] result = new D[3];
		for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			int x = i * 2 + 1;
			result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine(x); };
		}
		return result;
	}

	static void Main() {
		foreach (D d in F()) d();
	}
}
```
produces the output:

```csharp
1
3
5
```
However, when the declaration of `x` is moved outside the loop:

```csharp
static D[] F() {
	D[] result = new D[3];
	int x;
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		x = i * 2 + 1;
		result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine(x); };
	}
	return result;
}
```

the output is:

```csharp
5
5
5
```
Note that the compiler is permitted (but not required) to optimize the three instantiations into a single delegate instance (§11.7.2).

*end example*\]

If a for-loop declares an iteration variable, that variable itself is considered to be declared outside of the loop. \[*Example*: Thus, if the example is changed to capture the iteration variable itself:

```csharp
static D[] F() {
	D[] result = new D[3];
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine(i); };
	}
	return result;
}
```

only one instance of the iteration variable is captured, which produces the output:

```csharp
3
3
3
```
*end example*\]

It is possible for anonymous function delegates to share some captured variables yet have separate instances of others. \[*Example*: For example, if `F` is changed to

```csharp
static D[] F() {
	D[] result = new D[3];
	int x = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		int y = 0;
		result[i] = () => { Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", ++x, ++y); };
	}
	return result;
}
```
the three delegates capture the same instance of `x` but separate instances of `y`, and the output is:

```csharp
1 1
2 1
3 1
```

*end example*\]

Separate anonymous functions can capture the same instance of an outer variable. \[*Example*: In the example:

```csharp
using System;

delegate void Setter(int value);

delegate int Getter();

class Test
{
static void Main() {
	int x = 0;
	Setter s = (int value) => { x = value; };
	Getter g = () => { return x; };
	s(5);
	Console.WriteLine(g());
	s(10);
	Console.WriteLine(g());
	}
}
```
the two anonymous functions capture the same instance of the local variable `x`, and they can thus “communicate” through that variable. The output of the example is:

```csharp
5
10
```
*end example*\]

### Evaluation of anonymous function expressions

An anonymous function `F` shall always be converted to a delegate type `D` or an expression-tree type `E`, either directly or through the execution of a delegate creation expression new `D(F)`. This conversion determines the result of the anonymous function, as described in §11.7.

### Implementation Exmple

**This subclause is informative.**

This subclause describes a possible implementation of anonymous function conversions in terms of other `C\#` constructs. The implementation described here is based on the same principles used by a commercial `C\#` compiler, but it is by no means a mandated implementation, nor is it the only one possible. It only briefly mentions conversions to expression trees, as their exact semantics are outside the scope of this specification.

The remainder of this subclause gives several examples of code that contains anonymous functions with different characteristics. For each example, a corresponding translation to code that uses only other `C\#` constructs is provided. In the examples, the identifier `D` is assumed by represent the following delegate type:

```csharp
public delegate void D();
```

The simplest form of an anonymous function is one that captures no outer variables:

```csharp
class Test
{
	static void F() {
		D d = () => { Console.WriteLine("test"); };
	}
}
```
This can be translated to a delegate instantiation that references a compiler generated static method in which the code of the anonymous function is placed:

```csharp
class Test
{
	static void F() {
		D d = new D(__Method1);
	}

	static void __Method1() {
		Console.WriteLine("test");
	}
}
```

In the following example, the anonymous function references instance members of this:

```csharp
class Test
{
	int x;

	void F() {
		D d = () => { Console.WriteLine(x); };
	}
}
```

This can be translated to a compiler generated instance method containing the code of the anonymous function:

```csharp
class Test
{
	int x;

	void F() {
		D d = new D(__Method1);
	}

	void __Method1() {
		Console.WriteLine(x);
	}
}
```

In this example, the anonymous function captures a local variable:

```csharp
class Test
{
	void F() {
	int y = 123;
		D d = () => { Console.WriteLine(y); };
	}
}
```

The lifetime of the local variable must now be extended to at least the lifetime of the anonymous function delegate. This can be achieved by “hoisting” the local variable into a field of a compiler-generated class. Instantiation of the local variable (§12.16.6.3) then corresponds to creating an instance of the compiler generated class, and accessing the local variable corresponds to accessing a field in the instance of the compiler generated class. Furthermore, the anonymous function becomes an instance method of the compiler-generated class:

```csharp
class Test
{
	void F() {
		__Locals1 __locals1 = new __Locals1();
		__locals1.y = 123;
		D d = new D(__locals1.__Method1);
	}

	class __Locals1
	{
		public int y;

		public void __Method1() {
			Console.WriteLine(y);
		}
	}
}
```
Finally, the following anonymous function captures this as well as two local variables with different lifetimes:

```csharp
class Test
{
	int x;

	void F() {
		int y = 123;
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			int z = i * 2;
			D d = () => { Console.WriteLine(x + y + z); };
		}
	}
}
```

Here, a compiler-generated class is created for each statement block in which locals are captured such that the locals in the different blocks can have independent lifetimes. An instance of `__Locals2`, the compiler generated class for the inner statement block, contains the local variable `z` and a field that references an instance of `__Locals1`. An instance of `__Locals1`, the compiler generated class for the outer statement block, contains the local variable `y` and a field that references this of the enclosing function member. With these data structures, it is possible to reach all captured outer variables through an instance of `__Local2`, and the code of the anonymous function can thus be implemented as an instance method of that class.


```csharp
class Test
{
	void F() {
		__Locals1 __locals1 = new __Locals1();
		__locals1.__this = this;
		__locals1.y = 123;
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			__Locals2 __locals2 = new __Locals2();
			__locals2.__locals1 = __locals1;
			__locals2.z = i * 2;
			D d = new D(__locals2.__Method1);
		}
	}

	class __Locals1
	{
		public Test __this;
		public int y;
	}

	class __Locals2
	{
		public __Locals1 __locals1;
		public int z;

		public void __Method1() {
			Console.WriteLine(__locals1.__this.x + __locals1.y + z);
		}
	}
}
```

The same technique applied here to capture local variables can also be used when converting anonymous functions to expression trees: references to the compiler-generated objects can be stored in the expression tree, and access to the local variables can be represented as field accesses on these objects. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the “lifted” local variables to be shared between delegates and expression trees.

A query expression begins with a from clause and ends with either a select or group clause. The initial from clause may be followed by zero or more from, let, where, join or orderby clauses. Each from clause is a generator introducing a ***range variable*** that ranges over the elements of a ***sequence***. Each let clause introduces a range variable representing a value computed by means of previous range variables. Each where clause is a 
filter that excludes items from the result. Each join clause compares specified keys of the source sequence with keys of another sequence, yielding matching pairs. Each orderby clause reorders items according to specified criteria.The final select or group clause specifies the shape of the result in terms of the range variables. Finally, an into clause can be used to “splice” queries by treating the results of one query as a generator in a subsequent query.

### Ambiguities in query expressions

Query expressions use a number of contextual keywords (§7.4.4): `ascending, by, descending, equals, from, group, into, join, let, on, orderly, select` and `where`.

To avoid ambiguities that could arise from the use of these identifiers both as keywords and simple names these identifiers are considered keywords anywhere within a query expression, unless they are prefixed with “@” (§7.4.4) in which case they are considered identifiers. For this purpose, a query expression is any expression that starts with “from *identifier*” followed by any token except* `“;”, “=” or “,”`.

### Query expression translation

#### General

The C# language does not specify the execution semantics of query expressions. Rather, query expressions are translated into invocations of methods that adhere to the query*-*expression pattern (§12.17.4). Specifically, query expressions are translated into invocations of methods named `Where, Select, SelectMany, Join, GroupJoin, OrderBy, OrderByDescending`, `ThenBy, ThenByDescending, GroupBy,` and `Cast`. These methods are expected to have particular signatures and return types, as described in §12.17.4. These methods may be instance methods of the object being queried or extension methods that are external to the object. These methods implement the actual execution of the query.

The translation from query expressions to method invocations is a syntactic mapping that occurs before any type binding or overload resolution has been performed. Following translation of query expressions, the resulting method invocations are processed as regular method invocations, and this may in turn uncover compile time errors. These error conditions include, but are not limited to, methods that do not exist, arguments of the wrong types, and generic methods where type inference fails.

A query expression is processed by repeatedly applying the following translations until no further reductions are possible. The translations are listed in order of application: each section assumes that the translations in the preceding sections have been performed exhaustively, and once exhausted, a section will not later be revisited in the processing of the same query expression.

It is a compile time error for a query expression to include an assignment to a range variable, or the use of a range variable as an argument for a ref or out parameter.

Certain translations inject range variables with *transparent identifiers* denoted by \*. These are described further in §12.17.3.8.

#### select and group … by clauses with continuations

A query expression with a group clause using a property Prop of `y` and `a` query body `Q` containing a continuation in the form:

from `y` in `S` group `y` by `y`.Prop into `x Q`

is translated into:

from `x` in ( from `y `in `S` group `y` by `y.Prop` ) `Q`

The translations in the following sections assume that queries have no into continuations.

\[*Example*: The example:

```csharp
from c in customers
group c by c.Country into g
select new { Country = g.Key, CustCount = g.Count() }
```

is translated into:

```csharp
from g in
(from c in customers
group c by c.Country)
select new { Country = g.Key, CustCount = g.Count() }
```

the final translation of which is:

```csharp
customers.
GroupBy(c => c.Country).
Select(g => new { Country = g.Key, CustCount = g.Count() })
```

*end example*\]

#### Explicit range variable types

A from clause that explicitly specifies a range variable type

from `T` `x` in `e`

is translated into

from `x` in ( `e` ) . Cast < `T` > ( )

A join clause that explicitly specifies a range variable type

join `T` `x` in `e` on `k1` equals `k2`

is translated into

join `x` in ( `e` ) . Cast < `T` > ( ) on `k1` equals `k2`

The translations in the following sections assume that queries have no explicit range variable types.

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from Customer c in customers
where c.City == "London"
select c
```

is translated into

```csharp
from c in (customers).Cast<Customer>()
where c.City == "London"
select c
```
the final translation of which is

```csharp
customers.
Cast<Customer>().
Where(c => c.City == "London")
```
*end example*\]

> [!NOTE]
> Explicit range variable types are useful for querying collections that implement the non-generic `IEnumerable` interface, but not the generic `IEnumerable<T>` interface. In the example above, this would be the case if customers were of type `ArrayList`.

#### Degenerate query expressions

A query expression of the form

from `x` in `e` select `x`

is translated into

( `e` ) . Select ( `x` => `x` )

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
select c
```
Is translated into

```csharp
(customers).Select(c => c)
```

*end example*\]

A degenerate query expression is one that trivially selects the elements of the source.

> [!NOTE]
> Later phases of the translation (§12.17.3.6 and §12.17.3.7) remove degenerate queries introduced by other translation steps by replacing them with their source. It is important, however, to ensure that the result of a query expression is never the source object itself. Otherwise, returning the result of such a query might inadvertently expose private data (e.g., an element array) to a caller. Therefore this step protects degenerate queries written directly in source code by explicitly calling Select on the source. It is then up to the implementers of Select and other query operators to ensure that these methods never return the source object itself.

#### From, let, where, join and orderby clauses

A query expression with a second from clause followed by a select clause

```csharp
from x1 in e1\
from x2 in e2\
select v
```
is translated into

```csharp
( e1 ) . SelectMany( x1 => e2 , ( x1 , x2 ) => v )
```

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp

where `x` is a compiler generated identifier that is otherwise invisible and inaccessible. *end example*\]

A where expression along with its preceding from clause:

A join clause immediately followed by a select clause

```csharp

is translated into

```csharp

*end example*\]

The following translations assume that there are no let, where, join or orderby clauses, and no more than the one initial from clause in each query expression.

#### Select clauses

A query expression of the form

from `x` in `e` select `v`

is translated into

( `e` ) . Select ( `x` => `v` )

except when `v` is the identifier `x`, the translation is simply

( `e` )

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers.Where(c => c.City == “London”)
select c
```
is simply translated into

```csharp
(customers).Where(c => c.City == “London”)
```
*end example*\]

#### Group clauses

A group clause

from `x` in `e` group `v` by `k`

is translated into

( `e` ) . GroupBy ( `x` => `k` , `x` => `v` )

except when `v` is the identifier `x`, the translation is

( `e` ) . GroupBy ( `x` => `k` )

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
group c.Name by c.Country
```
is translated into

```csharp
(customers).
GroupBy(c => c.Country, c => c.Name)
```
*end example*\]

#### Transparent identifiers

Certain translations inject range variables with ***transparent identifiers*** denoted by \*. Transparent identifiers exist only as an intermediate step in the query-expression translation process.

When a query translation injects a transparent identifier, further translation steps propagate the transparent identifier into anonymous functions and anonymous object initializers. In those contexts, transparent identifiers have the following behavior:

-   When a transparent identifier occurs as a parameter in an anonymous function, the members of the associated anonymous type are automatically in scope in the body of the anonymous function.

-   When a member with a transparent identifier is in scope, the members of that member are in scope as well.

-   When a transparent identifier occurs as a member declarator in an anonymous object initializer, it introduces a member with a transparent identifier.

    In the translation steps described above, transparent identifiers are always introduced together with anonymous types, with the intent of capturing multiple range variables as members of a single object. An implementation of C# is permitted to use a different mechanism than anonymous types to group together multiple range variables. The following translation examples assume that anonymous types are used, and shows one possible translation of transparent identifiers.

\[*Example*: The example

```csharp
from c in customers
from o in c.Orders
orderby o.Total descending
select new { c.Name, o.Total }
```
is translated into

```csharp
from * in (customers).
SelectMany(c => c.Orders, (c,o) => new { c, o })
orderby o.Total descending
select new { c.Name, o.Total }
```
which is further translated into

```csharp
customers.
SelectMany(c => c.Orders, (c,o) => new { c, o }).
OrderByDescending(* => o.Total).
Select(\ => new { c.Name, o.Total })
```
which, when transparent identifiers are erased, is equivalent to

```csharp
customers.
SelectMany(c => c.Orders, (c,o) => new { c, o }).
OrderByDescending(x => x.o.Total).
Select(x => new { x.c.Name, x.o.Total })
```
where `x` is a compiler generated identifier that is otherwise invisible and inaccessible.

The example

```csharp
from c in customers
join o in orders on c.CustomerID equals o.CustomerID
join d in details on o.OrderID equals d.OrderID
join p in products on d.ProductID equals p.ProductID
select new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, p.ProductName }
```
is translated into

```csharp
from * in (customers).
Join(orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID,
(c, o) => new { c, o })
join d in details on o.OrderID equals d.OrderID
join p in products on d.ProductID equals p.ProductID
select new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, p.ProductName }
```
which is further reduced to

```csharp
customers.
Join(orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID, (c, o) => new { c, o }).
Join(details, * => o.OrderID, d => d.OrderID, (*, d) => new { *, d }).
Join(products, * => d.ProductID, p => p.ProductID, (*, p) => new { *, p }).
Select(\ => new { c.Name, o.OrderDate, p.ProductName })
```

[#_Ref130909184 .anchor](#_Ref130909184 .anchor)[#_Ref112572083 .anchor](#_Ref112572083 .anchor)the final translation of which is

```csharp
customers.
Join(orders, c => c.CustomerID, o => o.CustomerID,
(c, o) => new { c, o }).
Join(details, x => x.o.OrderID, d => d.OrderID,
(x, d) => new { x, d }).
Join(products, y => y.d.ProductID, p => p.ProductID,
(y, p) => new { y, p }).
Select(z => new { z.y.x.c.Name, z.y.x.o.OrderDate, z.p.ProductName })
```

where `x`, `y`, and `z` are compiler-generated identifiers that are otherwise invisible and inaccessible.

*end example*\]

### The query-expression pattern

The ***Query-expression pattern*** establishes a pattern of methods that types can implement to support query expressions.

A generic type `C<T>` supports the query-expression-pattern if its public member methods and the publicly accessible extension methods could be replaced by the following class definition. The members and accessible extenson methods is referred to as the "shape" of a generic type `C<T>`. A generic type is used in order to illustrate the proper relationships between parameter and return types, but it is possible to implement the pattern for non-generic types as well.

```csharp
delegate R Func<T1,R>(T1 arg1);

delegate R Func<T1,T2,R>(T1 arg1, T2 arg2);

class C
{
	public C<T> Cast<T>();
}

class C<T> : C
{
	public C<T> Where(Func<T,bool> predicate);

	public C<U> Select<U>(Func<T,U> selector);

	public C<V> SelectMany<U,V>(Func<T,C<U>> selector,
	Func<T,U,V> resultSelector);

	public C<V> Join<U,K,V>(C<U> inner, Func<T,K> outerKeySelector,
	Func<U,K> innerKeySelector, Func<T,U,V> resultSelector);

	public C<V> GroupJoin<U,K,V>(C<U> inner, Func<T,K> outerKeySelector,
	Func<U,K> innerKeySelector, Func<T,C<U>,V> resultSelector);

	public O<T> OrderBy<K>(Func<T,K> keySelector);

	public O<T> OrderByDescending<K>(Func<T,K> keySelector);

	public C<G<K,T>> GroupBy<K>(Func<T,K> keySelector);

	public C<G<K,E>> GroupBy<K,E>(Func<T,K> keySelector,
	Func<T,E> elementSelector);
}

class O<T> : C<T>
{
	public O<T> ThenBy<K>(Func<T,K> keySelector);

	public O<T> ThenByDescending<K>(Func<T,K> keySelector);
}

class G<K,T> : C<T>
{
	public K Key { get; }
}
```
The methods above use the generic delegate types Func`<T1, R>` and `Func<T1, T2, R>`, but they could equally well have used other delegate or expression-tree types with the same relationships in parameter and return types.

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended relationship between `C<T>` and `O<T>` that ensures that the ThenBy and ThenByDescending methods are available only on the result of an OrderBy or OrderByDescending.

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended shape of the result of GroupBy—a sequence of sequences, where each inner sequence has an additional Key property.

> [!NOTE]
> Because query expressions are translated to method invocations by means of a syntactic mapping, types have considerable flexibility in how they implement any or all of the query-expression pattern. For example, the methods of the pattern can be implemented as instance methods or as extension methods because the two have the same invocation syntax, and the methods can request delegates or expression trees because anonymous functions are convertible to both. Types implementing only some of the query expression pattern support only query expression translations that map to the methods that type supports.

> [!NOTE]
> The `System.Linq` namespace provides an implementation of the query-expression pattern for any type that implements the `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>` interface.

## Assignment operators

### General

The assignment operators assign a new value to a variable, a property, an event, or an indexer element.

[#Grammar_assignment .anchor](#Grammar_assignment .anchor)

```ANTLR
assignment:
	unary-expression assignment-operator expression
```	

[#Grammar_assignment_operator .anchor](#Grammar_assignment_operator .anchor)

```ANTLR
assignment-operator:
	*=
	+=
	-=
	\*=
	/=
	%=
	&=
	|=
	\^=
	<<=
```
*right-shift-assignment

The left operand of an assignment shall be an expression classified as a variable, a property access, an indexer access, or an event access.

The `=` operator is called the ***simple assignment operator***. It assigns the value of the right operand to the variable, property, or indexer element given by the left operand. The left operand of the simple assignment operator shall not be an event access (except as described in §15.8.2). The simple assignment operator is described in §12.18.2.

The assignment operators other than the `=` operator are called the ***compound assignment operators***. These operators perform the indicated operation on the two operands, and then assign the resulting value to the variable, property, or indexer element given by the left operand. The compound assignment operators are described in §12.18.3.

The `+=` and `-=` operators with an event access expression as the left operand are called the ***event assignment operators***. No other assignment operator is valid with an event access as the left operand. The event assignment operators are described in §12.18.4.

The assignment operators are right-associative, meaning that operations are grouped from right to left. \[*Example*: An expression of the form `a = b = c` is evaluated as `a = (b = c)`. *end example*\]

### Simple assignment

The `=` operator is called the simple assignment operator.

If the left operand of a simple assignment is of the form `E.P` or `E[Ei]` where `E` has the compile-time type dynamic, then the assignment is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the assignment expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time based on the run-time type of `E`. If the left operand is of the form `E[Ei]` where at least one element of `Ei` has the compile-time type dynamic, and the compile-time type of `E` is not an array, the resulting indexer access is dynamically bound, but with limited compile-time checking (§12.6.5).

In a simple assignment, the right operand shall be an expression that is implicitly convertible to the type of the left operand. The operation assigns the value of the right operand to the variable, property, or indexer element given by the left operand.

The result of a simple assignment expression is the value assigned to the left operand. The result has the same type as the left operand, and is always classified as a value.

If the left operand is a property or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have an accessible set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

The run-time processing of a simple assignment of the form `x` = `y` consists of the following steps:

-   If `x` is classified as a variable:

<!-- -->

-   `x` is evaluated to produce the variable.

-   `y` is evaluated and, if required, converted to the type of `x` through an implicit conversion (§11.2).

-   If the variable given by `x` is an array element of a *reference-type*, a run-time check is performed to ensure that the value computed for `y` is compatible with the array instance of which `x` is an element. The check succeeds if `y` is null, or if an implicit reference conversion (§11.2.7) exists from the -type of the instance referenced by `y` to the actual element type of the array instance containing `x`. Otherwise, a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` is thrown.

-   The value resulting from the evaluation and conversion of `y` is stored into the location given by the evaluation of `x`.

<!-- -->

-   If `x` is classified as a property or indexer access:

<!-- -->

-   The instance expression (if `x` is not static) and the argument list (if `x` is an indexer access) associated with `x` are evaluated, and the results are used in the subsequent set accessor invocation.

-   `y` is evaluated and, if required, converted to the type of `x` through an implicit conversion (§11.2).

-   The set accessor of `x` is invoked with the value computed for `y` as its value argument.

> [!NOTE]
> if the compile time type of `x` is dynamic and there is an implicit conversion from the compile time type of `y` to dynamic, no runtime resolution is required.

> [!NOTE]
> The array co-variance rules (§17.6) permit a value of an array type `A[]` to be a reference to an instance of an array type `B[]`, provided an implicit reference conversion exists from `B` to `A`. Because of these rules, assignment to an array element of a *reference-type* requires a run-time check to ensure that the value being assigned is compatible with the array instance. In the example

```csharp
string[] sa = new string[10];
object[] oa = sa;

oa[0] = null; // Ok
oa[1] = "Hello"; // Ok
oa[2] = new ArrayList(); // ArrayTypeMismatchException
```

the last assignment causes a `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` to be thrown because a reference to an ArrayList cannot be stored in an element of a `string[]`. *end note*\]

When a property or indexer declared in a *struct-type* is the target of an assignment, the instance expression associated with the property or indexer access shall be classified as a variable. If the instance expression is classified as a value, a binding-time error occurs.

> [!NOTE] 
> Because of §12.7.5, the same rule also applies to fields.


\[*Example*: Given the declarations:

```csharp
struct Point
{
	int x, y;

	public Point(int x, int y) {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	}

	public int X {
		get { return x; }
		set { x = value; }
	}

	public int Y {
		get { return y; }
		set { y = value; }
	}
}

struct Rectangle
{
	Point a, b;

	public Rectangle(Point a, Point b) {
		this.a = a;
		this.b = b;
	}

	public Point A {
		get { return a; }
		set { a = value; }
	}

	public Point B {
		get { return b; }
		set { b = value; }
	}
}
```

in the example

```csharp
Point p = new Point();
p.X = 100;
p.Y = 100;
Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
r.A = new Point(10, 10);
r.B = p;
```
the assignments to `p.X`, `p.Y`, `r.A`, and `r.B` are permitted because `p` and `r` are variables. However, in the example

```csharp
Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
r.A.X = 10;
r.A.Y = 10;
r.B.X = 100;
r.B.Y = 100;
```

the assignments are all invalid, since `r.A` and `r.B` are not variables. *end example*\]

### Compound assignment

If the left operand of a compound assignment is of the form `E.P` or `E[Ei]` where `E` has the compile-time type dynamic, then the assignment is dynamically bound (§12.3.3). In this case, the compile-time type of the assignment expression is dynamic, and the resolution described below will take place at run-time based on the run-time type of `E`. If the left operand is of the form `E[Ei]` where at least one element of `Ei` has the compile-time type dynamic, and the compile-time type of `E` is not an array, the resulting indexer access is dynamically bound, but with limited compile-time checking (§12.6.5).

An operation of the form `x` *op*= `y` is processed by applying binary operator overload resolution (§12.4.5) as if the operation was written `x op y`. Then,

-   If the return type of the selected operator is implicitly convertible to the type of `x`, the operation is evaluated as `x = x op y`, except that `x` is evaluated only once.

-   Otherwise, if the selected operator is a predefined operator, if the return type of the selected operator is explicitly convertible to the type of `x` , and if `y` is implicitly convertible to the type of `x`  or the operator is a shift operator, then the operation is evaluated as `x` = (`T)(x op y)`, where `T` is the type of `x`, except that `x` is evaluated only once.

-   Otherwise, the compound assignment is invalid, and a binding-time error occurs.

The term “evaluated only once” means that in the evaluation of `x op y`, the results of any constituent expressions of `x` are temporarily saved and then reused when performing the assignment to `x`. \[*Example*: In the assignment `A()\[B()\] += C()`, where `A` is a method returning `int[]`, and `B` and `C` are methods returning int, the methods are invoked only once, in the order `A, B, C`. *end example*\]

When the left operand of a compound assignment is a property access or indexer access, the property or indexer shall have both a get accessor and a set accessor. If this is not the case, a binding-time error occurs.

The second rule above permits `x op= y` to be evaluated as `x` = `(T)(x op y)` in certain contexts. The rule exists such that the predefined operators can be used as compound operators when the left operand is of type sbyte, byte, short, ushort, or char. Even when both arguments are of one of those types, the predefined operators produce a result of type int, as described in §12.4.7.3. Thus, without a cast it would not be possible to assign the result to the left operand.

The intuitive effect of the rule for predefined operators is simply that `x op= y` is permitted if both of `x op y` and `x = y` are permitted. \[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
byte b = 0;
char ch = '\\0';
int i = 0;

b += 1; // Ok
b += 1000; // Error, b = 1000 not permitted
b += i; // Error, b = i not permitted
b += (byte)i; // Ok

ch += 1; // Error, ch = 1 not permitted
ch += (char)1; // Ok
```

the intuitive reason for each error is that a corresponding simple assignment would also have been an error. *end example*\]

> [!NOTE]
> This also means that compound assignment operations support lifted operators. Since a compound assignment `x op= y` is evaluated as either `x = x op y or x = (T)(x op y)`, the rules of evaluation implicitly cover lifted operators.

### Event assignment

If the left operand of `a += or -=` operator is classified as an event access, then the expression is evaluated as follows:

-   The instance expression, if any, of the event access is evaluated.

-   The right operand of the `+= or -=` operator is evaluated, and, if required, converted to the type of the left operand through an implicit conversion (§11.2).

-   An event accessor of the event is invoked, with an argument list consisting of the value computed in the previous step. If the operator was `+=`, the add accessor is invoked; if the operator was `-=`, the remove accessor is invoked.

An event assignment expression does not yield a value. Thus, an event assignment expression is valid only in the context of a *statement-expression* (§13.7).

## Expression

An *expression* is either a *non-assignment-expression* or an *assignment*.

	non-assignment-expression
	assignment
```

```ANTLR
non-assignment-expression:
	conditional-expression
	lambda-expression
	query-expression
```
## Constant expressions

A constant expression is an expression that shall be fully evaluated at compile-time.

[#Grammar_constant_expression .anchor](#Grammar_constant_expression .anchor)

```ANTLR
constant-expression:
	expression
```

A constant expression may be either a value type or a reference type. If a constant expression is a value type, it must be one of the following types: `sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char, float, double, decimal, bool,` or any enumeration type. If a constant expression is a reference type, it must be the string type, a default value expression (§12.7.15) for some reference type, or the value of the expression must be null.

Only the following constructs are permitted in constant expressions:

-   Literals (including the null literal).

-   References to const members of class and struct types.

-   References to members of enumeration types.

-   References to const parameters or local variables

-   Parenthesized subexpressions, which are themselves constant expressions.

-   Cast expressions.

-   checked and unchecked expressions

-   The predefined `+, –, !`, and `~` unary operators.

-   The predefined `+, –, *, /, %, <<, >>, &, |, ^, &&, ||, ==, !=, <, >, <=`, and `>=` binary operators.

-   The `?:` conditional operator.

-   sizeof expressions, provided the unmanaged-type is one of the types specified in §23.6.9 for which sizeof returns a constant value.

-   Default value expressions, provided the type is one of the types listed above.

The following conversions are permitted in constant expressions:

-   Identity conversions

-   Numeric conversions

-   Enumeration conversions

-   Constant expression conversions

-   Implicit and explicit reference conversions, provided the source of the conversions is a constant expression that evaluates to the null value.

> [!NOTE]
> Other conversions including boxing, unboxing, and implicit reference conversions of non-null values are not permitted in constant expressions.

\[*Example*: In the following code

```csharp
class C {
const object i = 5; // error: boxing conversion not permitted
const object str = “hello”; // error: implicit reference conversion
}
```
the initialization of `i` is an error because a boxing conversion is required. The initialization of `str` is an error because an implicit reference conversion from a non-null value is required. *end example*\]

Whenever an expression fulfills the requirements listed above, the expression is evaluated at compile-time. This is true even if the expression is a subexpression of a larger expression that contains non-constant constructs.

The compile-time evaluation of constant expressions uses the same rules as run-time evaluation of non-constant expressions, except that where run-time evaluation would have thrown an exception, compile-time evaluation causes a compile-time error to occur.

Unless a constant expression is explicitly placed in an unchecked context, overflows that occur in integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions during the compile-time evaluation of the expression always cause compile-time errors (§12.7.14).

Constant expressions are required in the contexts listed below and this is indicated in the grammar by using *constant-expression*. In these contexts, a compile-time error occurs if an expression cannot be fully evaluated at compile-time.

-   Constant declarations (§15.4)

-   Enumeration member declarations (§19.4)

-   Default arguments of formal parameter lists (§15.6.2)

-   case labels of a switch statement (§13.8.3).

-   goto case statements (§13.10.4)

-   Dimension lengths in an array creation expression (§12.7.11.5) that includes an initializer.

-   Attributes (§22)

An implicit constant expression conversion (§11.2.10) permits a constant expression of type int to be converted to `sbyte, byte, short, ushort, uint`, or `ulong`, provided the value of the constant expression is within the range of the destination type.

## Boolean expressions

A *boolean-expression* is an expression that yields a result of type bool; either directly or through application of operator true in certain contexts as specified in the following:

```csharp
boolean-expression:
	expression
```

The controlling conditional expression of an *if-statement* (§13.8.2), *while-statement* (§13.9.2), *do-statement* (§13.9.3), or *for-statement* (§13.9.4) is a *boolean-expression*. The controlling conditional expression of the `?:` operator (§12.15) follows the same rules as a *boolean-expression*, but for reasons of operator precedence is classified as a *conditional-or-expression*.

A boolean-expression `E` is required to be able to produce a value of type bool, as follows:

-   If E is implicitly convertible to bool then at run-time that implicit conversion is applied.

-   Otherwise, unary operator overload resolution (§12.4.4) is used to find a unique best implementation of operator true on `E`, and that implementation is applied at run-time.

-   If no such operator is found, a binding-time error occurs.
