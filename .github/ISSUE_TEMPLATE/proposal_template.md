Hello, and thanks for your interest in contributing to C#! If you haven't been invited by a language design team member to open an issue, please instead open a discussion marked [draft issue] at https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/new and we'll try to give you feedback on how to get to an issue-ready proposal.

This issue should give a very brief description of the feature, with the more complete description and design being contained in the proposal specification. This issue will be used for tracking purposes, and should have enough information to make it obvious what the feature is about for a casual reader.
