## Summary
[summary]: #summary

The "readonly locals and parameters" feature is actually a group or features that declare local variables and method parameters without exposing the state to modifications.

# Prevoius work

There is an existing proposal that touches this topic https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/115 as a special case of readonly parameters without going into many details. 
Here I just want to acknowledge that the idea by itself is not new anyway.
