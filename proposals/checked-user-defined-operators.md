## Detailed design

<!-- This is the bulk of the proposal. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the language to understand, and for somebody familiar with the compiler to implement, and include examples of how the feature is used. Please include syntax and desired semantics for the change, including linking to the relevant parts of the existing C# spec to describe the changes necessary to implement this feature. An initial proposal does not need to cover all cases, but it should have enough detail to enable a language team member to bring this proposal to design if they so choose. -->
