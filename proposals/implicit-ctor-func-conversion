# implicit-ctor-func-conversion

* [x] Proposed
* [ ] Prototype: [Complete](https://github.com/PROTOTYPE_OWNER/roslyn/BRANCH_NAME)
* [ ] Implementation: [In Progress](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/BRANCH_NAME)
* [ ] Specification: [Not Started](pr/1)

## Summary
[summary]: #summary

Wherever the paramter required is a Func<T, T2> you can supply a T2 constructor that requires T as a parameter

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

for example you can do something like that 
```csharp
new []{5}.Select(new List<object>);
```
which is the same as :
```csharp
new []{5}.Select(num => new List<object>(num));
```

## Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

This is the bulk of the proposal. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the language to understand, and for somebody familiar with the compiler to implement,  and include examples of how the feature is used. This section can start out light before the prototyping phase but should get into specifics and corner-cases as the feature is iteratively designed and implemented.
