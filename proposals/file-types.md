# File types

## Summary
[summary]: #summary

Permit a `file` modifier on top-level type declarations. The type only exists in the file where it is declared.

```cs
// File1.cs
namespace NS;

file class Widget
{
}

// File2.cs
namespace NS;

file class Widget // different symbol than the Widget in File1
{
}

// File3.cs
using NS;

var widget = new Widget(); // error: The type or namespace name 'Widget' could not be found.
```

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Our primary motivation is from source generators. Source generators work by adding files to the user's compilation.
1. Those files should be able to contain implementation details which are hidden from the rest of the compilation, yet are usable throughout the file they are declared in.
2. We want to reduce the need for generators to "search" for type names which won't collide with declarations in user code or code from other generators.

## Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

- We add the `file` modifier to the [class](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v6/standard/classes.md#1422-class-modifiers), [struct](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v6/standard/structs.md#1522-struct-modifiers), [interface](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v6/standard/interfaces.md#1722-interface-modifiers), and [enum](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v6/standard/enums.md#183-enum-modifiers) modifier sets in the grammar.
- The `file` modifier can only be used on a top-level type.

### Accessibility
No accessibility modifiers can be used in combination with `file` on a type. `file` is treated as an independent concept from accessibility. Since file types can't be nested, only the default accessibility `internal` is usable with `file` types.

```cs
public file class C1 { } // error
internal file class C2 { } // error
file class C3 { } // ok
```

### Naming
The implementation guarantees that `file` types in different files with the same name will be distinct to the runtime. The type's accessibility and name in metadata is implementation-defined. The intention is to permit the compiler to adopt any future access-limitation features in the runtime which are suited to the feature. It's expected that in the initial implementation, an `internal` accessibility would be used and an unspeakable generated name will be used which depends on the file the type is declared in.

### Lookup
We amend the [member lookup](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard/blob/draft-v7/standard/expressions.md#115-member-lookup) section as follows (new text in **bold**):

> - Next, if `K` is zero, all nested types whose declarations include type parameters are removed. If `K` is not zero, all members with a different number of type parameters are removed. When `K` is zero, methods having type parameters are not removed, since the type inference process ([ยง11.6.3](expressions.md#1163-type-inference)) might be able to infer the type arguments.
> - **Next, let *F* be the compilation unit which contains the expression where member lookup is occurring. All members which are file types and are not declared in *F* are removed from the set.**
> - **Next, if the set of accessible members contains file types, all non-file types are removed from the set.**

#### Remarks
These rules disallow usage of file types outside the file in which they are declared.

These rules also permit *shadowing* of a non-file type by a file type:
```cs
// File1.cs
class C
{
    public static void M() { }
}
```

```cs
// File2.cs
file class C
{
    public static void M() { }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        C.M(); // refers to the 'C' in File2.cs
    }
}
```

### Attributes
A type which is both an attribute type and a file type is said to be a *file attribute*. Much like an ordinary *file types*, a *file attribute* can only be used in the file where it is declared.

```cs
// File1.cs
file class Attr : System.Attribute { }

[Attr] // ok
class Program { }
```

```cs
// File2.cs
[Attr] // error
class Other { }
```

### Usage in signatures
There is a general need to prevent `file` types from appearing in member signatures where the `file` type might not be in scope at the point of usage of the member.

#### Only allow signature usage in members of `file` types
Perhaps the simplest way to ensure this is to enforce that `file` types can only appear in signatures or as base types of other `file` types:

```cs
file class FileBase
{
}

public class Derived : FileBase // error
{
    private FileBase M2() => new FileBase() // error
}

file class FileDerived : FileBase // ok
{
    private FileBase M2() => new FileBase() // ok
}
```

Note that this does restrict usage in explicit implementations, even though such usages are safe. We do this in order to simplify the rules for the initial iteration of the feature.

```cs
file interface I
{
    void M(I i);
}

class C : I
{
    void I.M(I i) { } // error
}
```

### Implementation/overrides
`file` scoped type declarations can implement interfaces, override virtual methods, etc. just like regular type declarations.

```cs
file struct Widget : IEquatable<Widget>
{
    public bool Equals(Widget other) => true;
}
```
